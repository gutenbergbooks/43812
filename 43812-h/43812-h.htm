<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="toclink"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></p>

<p>Accounts of dare-devil exploits have always been
read with deep interest. One of the salient features
of human nature is curiosity, a desire to know what is
being said and done outside the narrow limits of one's
individual experience, or, in other words, to learn the
modes of life of persons whose environment and
problems are different from one's own environment
and problems. To this natural curiosity, the book
of travel is particularly gratifying.</p>

<p>But when we add to the fact that such a narrative
treats of races and conditions almost unknown to the
inhabitants of civilised countries the consideration that
those voyageurs to whom the adventures fell are men
and women already prominently before the public,
and so deserving of that public's special confidence, the
interest and value of such a work will be seen to be
extraordinarily enhanced.</p>

<p>The cruise of Jack London's forty-five-foot ketch
<i>Snark</i> was followed eagerly by the press of several
continents. The <i>Snark</i> alone was enough to compel
attention, but the <i>Snark</i> sailed by Jack London, a
writer of world-wide celebrity, was irresistible. The
venture caught the world's fancy. Periodicals devoted
columns to a discussion of the <i>Snark</i> and her
builder, and to the daring crew who sailed the tiny
craft for two years through the South Seas.</p>

<p>When it became known that such a voyage was in
contemplation, hundreds of persons wrote to Mr. London,
begging that he allow them to accompany him.
On the other extreme, they were legion who threw
up their hands in horror at the mere suggestion. The
belief was widespread, and was, indeed, almost universally
expressed, that the famous writer and his
fellows were setting out on a cruise from which there
would be no return. As an instance of the capriciousness
of things maritime and the fallibility of human
judgment, it is interesting to reflect that the <i>Snark</i>,
a ten-ton yacht, the stanchness of which was greatly
doubted, travelled her watery miles without mishap,
and is still afloat, while the <i>Titanic</i>, the most wonderful
craft that ever put out to sea, the last word in
shipbuilding, declared unsinkable, bore over a thousand
of her passengers to death, and lies to-day, a
twisted mass of wreckage, irrecoverably lost in the
depths of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Hardships there were a-plenty for the little yacht's
crew, of which seasickness was not the least. The
<i>Snark</i> was not a "painted ship upon a painted ocean."
Even a seasoned sailor would find it difficult to accustom
himself to the pitch and toss of so small a
boat. The effect upon the <i>Snark's</i> complement, composed
mainly of "landlubbers," may easily be imagined.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin Johnson, who started in as cook, soon
became the close friend and chief companion of Mr.
London. He was thus enabled to make studies of
the South Sea natives, many of whom are unquestionably
the strangest creatures in existence. His <a id="photographic"></a>photographic
records—over seven thousand different negatives—are
the finest in the world: they are absolutely
unique. We have read of some few of the little-known
places visited by the voyageurs, in Mr. London's
"Cruise of the <i>Snark</i>"; but the present work, being
much more detailed and complete, gives the first real
insight into life aboard the yacht and among the myriad
islands of the South Pacific. The illustrations are
from photographs made by Mr. Johnson, with a few
from prints by Mr. J. W. Beattie, of Tasmania.</p>

<p>After reading such a narrative, we seem to lose
our wonder at the voyages of vessels like the <i>Half
Moon</i>, the <i>Pinta</i>, and the <i>Santa Maria</i>. Surely the
playing of sea-pranks can go no further. The conclusion
seems justifiable that if men are to outdo the
exploits of the past, they will only succeed by forsaking
the water and mastering the air.<br />

 THROUGH THE SOUTH SEAS<br />WITH JACK LONDON</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I<br />
ON THE TRAIL OF ADVENTURE</h2>

<p class="toclink"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></p>

<p class="xpno"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1"></a>p001</p>

<p>Through all my twenty years of life I had been in
pursuit of Adventure. But Adventure eluded me.
Many and many a time, when I thought that at last
the prize was mine, she turned, and by some trickery
slipped from my grasp. The twenty years were
passed, and still there she was—Adventure!—in
the road ahead of me, and I, unwearied by our many
skirmishes, still following. The lure was always
golden. I could not give it up. Somewhere, sometime,
I knew that the advantage would incline my way,
and that I should close down my two hands firmly upon
her, and hold her fast. Adventure would be mine!</p>

<p>I thought, when I made it across the Atlantic on a
cattle-boat, and trod the soil of several alien countries
of the Old World, that I had won. But it was not
so. It was but the golden reflection of Adventure
that I had caught up with, and not the glorious thing
itself. She was still there, ahead of me, and I still
must needs pursue.</p>

<p>In my native Independence, Kansas, I sat long hours
in my father's jewellry store, and dreamed as I worked.
I ranged in vision over all the broad spaces of a world-chart.
In this dream-realm, there were no impediments
to my journeying. Through long ice-reaches,
 <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>p002</span>
across frozen rivers, over snow-piled mountains, I
forced my way to the Poles. I skimmed over boundless
tracts of ocean. Giant continents beckoned me
from coast to coast. Here was an island, rearing its
grassy back out of the great Pacific. My fancy invaded
it. Or here was a lofty mountain-chain, over
whose snow-capped summits I roamed at pleasure, communing
with the sky. Then there were the valley-deeps;
dropping down the steep descents on my mount,
I explored their sheltered wonders with unceasing delight.
Nothing was inaccessible. I walked in lands
where queer people, in costumes unfamiliar, lived out
their lives in ways which puzzled me, yet fascinated;
my way led often amid strange trees and grasses and
shrubs—their names unguessable. To the farthest
limits of East and West I sallied, and North and
South, knew no barriers but the Poles. I breathed
strange airs; I engaged in remarkable pursuits; by
night, unfamiliar stars and constellations glittered in
the sky. It is so easy, travelling—on the map.
There are no rigid limitations. Probabilities do not
bother. Latitude and longitude are things unnoticed.</p>

<p>But all these dreams were presaging a reality.
How it came about I hardly know. I must have tired
out that glorious thing, Adventure, with my long pursuit;
or else she grew kind to me, and fluttered into
my clasp. One evening, during the fall of 1906, while
passing away an hour with my favourite magazine, my
attention was attracted to an article describing a proposed <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>p003</span>
trip round the world on a little forty-five-foot
boat, by Jack London and a party of five. Instantly,
I was all aglow with enthusiasm, and before I had
finished the article I had mapped out a plan of action.
If that boat made a trip such as described, I was going
to be on the boat. It is needless to say that the letter
I immediately wrote to Mr. Jack London was as
strong as I could make it.</p>

<p>I did my best to convince Mr. London that I was
the man he needed. I told him all I could do, and
some things I couldn't do, laying special stress on the
fact that I had at one time made a trip from Chicago
to Liverpool, London, and Brussels, returning by
way of New York with twenty-five cents of the original
five dollars and a half with which I had started.
There were other things in that letter, though just
what they were I cannot now remember, nor does it
matter. My impatience was great as I awaited Mr.
London's reply. Yet I dared not believe anything
would come of it. That would be impossible. Why,
I knew that my letter was one of a host of letters;
I knew that among those who had applied must be
many who could push far stronger claims than mine;
and so, hoping against odds, I looked to the outcome
with no particular optimism.</p>

<p>Then, four days later, when hope had about dwindled
away, the impossible happened. I was standing in my
father's jewellry store after supper on the evening of
Monday, November 12, 1906, when a messenger boy <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>p004</span>
came in and handed me a telegram. The instant I saw
the little yellow envelope, something told me that this
was the turning-point in my life. With trembling
hands I tore it open, my heart beating wildly with
excitement. It was Jack London's reply, the fateful
slip of paper that was to dictate my acts for several
years to come.</p>

<p>The telegram was dated from Oakland, California,
a few hours earlier in the day. "Can you
cook?" it asked. And I had no sooner read it than
I had framed the reply. A little later it was burning
over the wires in the direction of California. Could
I cook? "Sure. Try me," I replied, with the bold
audacity of youth—and then settled myself down to
another wait.</p>

<p>The interval was brief. I spent it in learning how
to cook. One of my local friends gave me temporary
employment in his restaurant; and when, on Friday,
the 23rd, the first letter came from Jack London, I
had already been through the cook-book from cover
to cover, learning the secrets of the cuisine: bread-baking
and cake-making, the preparing of sauces and
puddings and omelets, fruit, game, and fowl—in short,
the "chemistry of the kitchen"; and what of my
practical experience in the restaurant, I had even
served up two or three experimental messes that seemed
to me fairly creditable for a beginner.</p>

<p>The letter was long and detailed. It spoke of the <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>p005</span>
ship, of the crew, of the plans—to use Mr. London's
own words, it let me know just what I was in for.</p>

<p>There were to be six aboard, all-told. There were
Jack and Mrs. London; Captain Roscoe Eames, who
is Mrs. London's uncle; Paul H. Tochigi, a Jap cabin-boy;
Herbert Stolz, an all-around athlete, fresh from
Stanford University; and lastly, there was to be myself,
the cook. We were to sail southern seas and northern
seas, bays and inland rivers, lakes and creeks—anything
navigable. And we were not to stop until we
had circled the planet. We were to visit the principal
countries of the world, spending from three to six
months in every port. It was planned that we should
not be home for at least seven years.</p>

<p>"It is the strongest boat ever built in San Francisco,"
ran the letter. "We could go through a typhoon that
would wreck a 15,000-ton steamer.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. Practically,
for every week that we are on the ocean, we will be
a month in port. For instance, we expect that it will
take us three weeks to sail from here to Hawaii, where
we expect to remain three months—of course, in various
portions of the Islands.</p>

<p>"Now as to the crew: All of us will be the crew.
There is my wife, and myself. We will stand our
watches and do our trick at the wheel.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. When
it comes to doing the trick at the wheel, I want to explain
that this will not be arduous as it may appear at
first. It is our intention, by sail-trimming, to make <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>p006</span>
the boat largely sail herself, without steering. Next,
in bad weather, there will be no steering, for then
we will be hove-to. But watches, or rather lookouts,
must be kept at night, when we are sailing. Suppose
we divide day and night into twelve hours each.
There are six of us all-told on the boat. Each will
take a two-hour turn on deck.</p>

<p>"Of course, when it comes to moments of danger,
or to doing something ticklish, or to making port, etc.,
the whole six of us will then become the crew. I will
not be a writer, but a sailor. The same with my wife.
The cabin-boy will be a sailor, and so also, the cook.
In fact, when it's a case for all hands, all hands it will
be.</p>

<p>"From the present outlook, we shall sail out of
San Francisco Bay on December 15. So you see, if
you accompany us, you will miss your Christmas at
home.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. Incidentally, if you like boxing, I may
tell you that all of us box, and we'll have the gloves
along. You'll have the advantage of us on reach.
Also, I may say that we should all of us have lots of
good times together, swimming, fishing, adventuring,
doing a thousand-and-one things.</p>

<p>"Now, about clothes. Remember that the boat is
small, also that we are going into hot weather and
shall be in hot weather all the time. So bring a small
outfit, and one for use in warm weather."</p>

<p>Thereafter, my days and nights were more golden
than ever with dreams. The days flew by swiftly, but <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>p007</span>
their heels seemed heavy to the anxious wight who
spent his hours grubbing in a restaurant. It appeared
to me that the time for my departure would never
come. I shudder as I think of what weird messes I
may have served up to my friend's customers in the
moments of my abstraction. Meanwhile, a letter
from Mrs. London dropped in, telling me how to get
my passport. At last the day came for my going.
A letter was pressed into my hands by one of my
local friends, who was an Elk, even as I. When I
opened it, I found it to be an introduction for me
wherever I might find myself. Surely here was good-will
and loyalty of which to be proud; and doubly
proud was I when I found that the letter was endorsed
by the Grand Exalted Ruler of the Elks. As I was
later to find, this little slip of paper would open many
a door which otherwise had remained shut to me.</p>

<p>With only a small satchel of clothing and a camera,
I boarded a Santa Fé train, said the last good-byes,
and sped westward toward California. The dreams
did not cease as I passed through the several states
that intervened. Whether by day or by night, they
persisted. That glorious will-o'-the-wisp, Adventure,
was still before me, though now much nearer and more
tantalising. But the advantage was mine. Mounted
on that monster of steam and iron, the modern train,
I felt that Adventure would be hard put for speed
in a race with me. And yet, that train seemed to
me the slowest thing that ever ran on two rails.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>p008</span></p>

<p>My thoughts kept constantly turning upon the man
whom I was journeying to meet. What sort of being
was he, that had compelled the attention of
the world by the magic of his pen, and by the daring
of his exploits? One thing I knew. The places I
had roamed in fancy, his foot had trod in reality.
And he had sailed over the seas. In '97, he was a
gold-seeker in the far North. He had been a sailor
and a tramp, an oyster-pirate, a Socialist agitator, and
a member of the San Francisco Bay fish-patrol. His
voyages up to this time had carried him far over the
earth, and his experiences would overlap the experiences
of an ordinary man a score of times and more.
Above all, he was a student, and a writer of world-wide
celebrity. Wherever civilised men congregated,
wherever books were read, the name of Jack London
was familiar.</p>

<p>Why he was making this trip in so tiny a craft?
That question he answered shortly afterward, when
he wrote: "Life that lives is life successful, and success
is the breath of its nostrils. The achievement
of a difficult feat is successful adjustment to a sternly
exacting environment. The more difficult the feat, the
greater the satisfaction at its accomplishment. That
is why I am building the <i>Snark</i>. I am so made. The
trip around the world means big moments of living.
Bear with me a moment and look at it. Here am I,
a little animal called a man—a bit of vitalised matter,
one hundred and sixty-five pounds of meat and blood, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>p009</span>
nerve, sinew, bones and brain—all of it soft and tender,
susceptible to hurt, fallible and frail. I strike
a light back-handed blow on the nose of an obstreperous
horse, and a bone in my hand is broken. I put my
head under the water for five minutes, and I am
drowned. I fall twenty feet through the air, and I
am smashed. I am a creature of temperature. A
few degrees one way, and my fingers and ears and
toes blacken and drop off. A few degrees the other
way, and my skin blisters and shrivels away from the
raw, quivering flesh. A few additional degrees either
way, and the light and life in me go out. A drop of
poison injected into my body from a snake, and I
cease to move—forever I cease to move. A splinter
of lead from a rifle enters my head, and I am wrapped
around in the eternal blackness.</p>

<p>"Fallible and frail, a bit of pulsating, jelly-like
life—it is all I am. About me are the great natural
forces—colossal menaces, Titans of destruction, unsentimental
monsters that have less concern for me
than I have for the grain of sand I crush under my
foot. They have no concern for me at all. They
do not know me. They are unconscious, unmerciful,
and unmoral. They are the cyclones and tornadoes,
lightning flashes and cloudbursts, tide-rips and tidal
waves, undertows and waterspouts, great whirls and
sucks and eddies, earthquakes and volcanoes, surfs
that thunder on rock-ribbed coasts, and seas that leap
aboard the largest crafts that float, crushing humans <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>p010</span>
to pulp or licking them off into the sea and to death—and
these insensate monsters do not know that tiny
sensitive creature, all nerves and weaknesses, whom
men call Jack London, and who himself thinks he is
all right and quite a superior being.</p>

<p>"In the maze and chaos of the conflict of these vast
and draughty Titans, it is for me to thread my precarious
way. The bit of life that is I will exult over
them."</p>

<p>And again:</p>

<p>"Being alive, I want to see, and all the world is
a bigger thing to see than one small town or valley.
We have done little outlining of the voyage. Only
one thing is definite, and that is that our first port
of call will be Honolulu. Beyond a few general ideas,
we have no thought of our next port after Hawaii.
We shall make up our minds as we get nearer. In
a general way, we know that we shall wander through
the South Seas, take in Samoa, New Zealand, Tasmania,
Australia, New Guinea, Borneo, and Sumatra,
and go on up through the Philippines to Japan. Then
will come Korea, China, India, the Red Sea, and the
Mediterranean. After that the voyage becomes too
vague to describe, though we know a number of things
we shall surely do, and we expect to spend from one to
several months in every country in Europe."</p>

<p>The article in the magazine, which had first drawn
my attention to the proposed trip, had given me little
knowledge of the man with whom in all probability <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>p011</span>
I was to spend the next seven years of my life. The
nearer I came to Oakland, the California city in which
the Londons were then living, the more intense grew
my curiosity. Worst of all, I was haunted by a fear
that if I didn't hustle and get there, Jack London
would have changed his mind, and I should be obliged
to come back in humiliation to Independence.</p>

<p>It was about nine o'clock in the evening when I
arrived in Oakland. As soon as I was off the train, I
hunted a telephone and called up Jack London. It
was London himself who came to the 'phone. When
I told him who I was, I heard a pleasant voice say:
"Hello, boy; come right along up," and then followed
instructions as to how to find the house.</p>

<p>They lived in a splendid section of the town. I
had no difficulty in finding them. When I rapped at
the door, a neat little woman opened it, and grabbing
my hand, almost wrung it off.</p>

<p>"Come right in," cried Mrs. London. "Jack's
waiting for you."</p>

<p>At that moment a striking young man of thirty,
with very broad shoulders, a mass of wavy auburn
hair, and a general atmosphere of boyishness, appeared
at the doorway, and shot a quick, inquisitive look at
me from his wide grey eyes. Inside, I could see all
manner of oars, odd assortments of clothing, books,
papers, charts, guns, cameras, and folding canoes, piled
in great stacks upon the floor.</p>

<p>"Hello, Martin," he said, stretching out his hand.
 <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>p012</span></p>

<p>"Hello, Jack," I answered. We gripped.</p>

<p>And that is how I met Jack London, traveller, novelist,
and social reformer; and that is how, for the first
time, I really ran shoulder to shoulder with Adventure,
which I had been pursuing all my days.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II<br />
THE BUILDING OF THE "SNARK"</h2>
<p class="toclink"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></p>
<p>The morning after my arrival in Oakland, I met
the other members of the <i>Snark</i> crew—the <i>Snarkites</i>,
as Mrs. London called them. Stolz certainly lived up
to his description. He was then about twenty-one
years of age, and a stronger fellow for his years I have
never seen anywhere, nor one so possessed of energy.
Paul H. Tochigi, the Japanese cabin-boy, was a manly
little fellow of twenty, who had only been in America
one year. Captain Eames was a fine, kindly old man,
the architect and superintendent of construction of
the <i>Snark</i>, and was booked to be her navigator.</p>

<p>At the time of my coming to California, the <i>Snark</i>
had already been several months in the building. And
her growth promised to be a slow one. Everything
went wrong. More than once, Jack shook his head
and sighed: "She was born unfortunately."</p>

<p>Planned to cost seven thousand dollars, by the time
she was finished she cost thirty thousand. To a ship-wise
man, this will seem an impossible amount to spend
on so small a craft. But everything was of the highest
quality on the <i>Snark</i>; labour and materials the very
best that money could buy. I really believe she was
the strongest boat ever built.</p>

<p>The idea of the trip had first come to Jack and <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>p014</span>
Captain Eames up at Jack's ranch near Glen Ellen.
While in the swimming pool one day, their conversation
turned to boats. Jack cited the case of Captain
Joshua Slocum, who left Boston one fair day in a little
thirty-foot boat, <i>Spray</i>, went round the world, by
himself, and came back on another fair day, three
years later, and made fast to the identical post from
which he had cast loose on the day of his start. This
led to some speculation; and out of it all, the idea
of a forty-foot yacht emerged. Later, of course, the
idea took on tangible dimensions, and a few more feet,
evolving at last into the <i>Snark</i>. At one time, Jack
had thought of calling the yacht the <i>Wolf</i>—a nickname
applied to him by his friends—but afterward
found the name <i>Snark</i> in one of Lewis Carroll's nonsense
books, and forthwith adopted it.</p>

<p>The start had originally been planned for October
1, 1906. But she did not sail on October 1, because
she was not yet finished. She was promised on November
1; again she was delayed—because not finished.
It was then deemed advisable to postpone sailing
until November 15; but when that date rolled
around and the <i>Snark</i> was still in the process of construction,
December 1 was decided on as the auspicious
time for a start. And still the <i>Snark</i> grew and grew,
and was never ready. In his letter to me, Jack had
set December 15 as the sailing-date; but on December
15 we did not sail.</p>

<p>During the next three months, I lived at the London <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>p015</span>
home, and my principal occupation was watching
the building of the <i>Snark</i> at Anderson's Ways,
in San Francisco, right across the bay from Oakland.
Anderson's Ways was about one mile from the Union
Iron Works, where the big battleships for the American
navy are built. There were several reasons
for the trouble experienced in getting the <i>Snark</i> ready
for her long sea-bath. To begin with, San Francisco
was just beginning to rise anew from wreck and ashes,
and the demand for workmen was urgent. Wages
soared skyward; it was almost impossible to hire carpenters,
or workmen of any sort. And things that
Jack ordinarily could have bought in San Francisco,
he was obliged to order from New York. Then, too,
so many freight-cars were heading for the ruined city
that a terrible tangle resulted, and it was difficult to
find the consignments of goods needed for the <i>Snark</i>.
One freight-car, containing oak ribs for the boat, had
arrived the day after the earthquake, but it had taken
a full month to find it. Nothing went right. To
cap matters, the big strike closed down the shipbuilding
plants that furnished us with supplies. The <i>Snark</i>
seemed indeed born into trouble!</p>

<p>All this time, Jack was toiling continually at his
desk, earning money; and all this time Roscoe Eames
was spending money freely to make the <i>Snark</i>
come up to their idea of what a boat should be. Jack
was obliged to borrow in the neighbourhood of ten
thousand dollars, for the <i>Snark's</i> bills came pouring <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>p016</span>
in faster than he could earn money to pay them. He
was determined to make of the <i>Snark</i> a thing of beauty
and strength—something unique in the history of
ocean-going vessels.</p>

<p>Some hundreds of persons wrote to Jack, begging
him to let them go with him on the cruise. Every mail
contained such letters. They continued to pour in almost
up to the day we sailed out of the Golden Gate.
Most of these letters Jack showed to me. Here was
a chef in a big hotel in Philadelphia, a man getting
over two hundred dollars a month, who offered his
services free. A college professor volunteered to do
any kind of work, and give one thousand dollars for
the privilege. Another man, the son of a millionaire,
offered five hundred dollars to go along. Still another
declared that he would put up any amount of money
if Jack would allow his son to be one of the crew.
And there were offers and solicitations from schoolteachers,
draftsmen, authors, photographers, secretaries,
stenographers, physicians, surgeons, civil engineers,
cooks, typists, dentists, compositors, reporters,
adventurers, sailors, valets, "lady companions" for
Mrs. London, stewards, machinists, engineers, high-school
and university students, electricians—men and
women of every imaginable trade, profession or inclination.
I began to have misgivings when I thought
of the fine chefs who had applied. I contrasted their
skilled ability with the little that I had learned from
the cook-book! It was just such things as these that <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>p017</span>
made me feel how lucky I was to be a member of the
crew of the <i>Snark</i>.</p>

<p>There was much protest from the Londons' friends.
Many freely expressed the sentiment that they could
not see how sensible people would even think of such
a trip. And they all knew, with profound certitude,
that we were to be drowned. But we paid very little
attention to their ominous head-shakings and pessimistic
predictions. We who were setting out in search of
Adventure were not to be balked by mere words.
Also, a number of Jack's Socialist friends wrote letters,
urging him to abandon what they evidently considered
folly. On every side of us, the conviction was openly
aired that we were on our way to the bottom of the
sea.</p>

<p>Jack was still spending long hours at his desk. Just
then, he was writing his story, "Goliah." One day
he read me the first part of it, in which he destroyed
the Japanese navy.</p>

<p>"And to-day I destroy the American navy," he told
me, gleefully. "Oh, I haven't a bit of conscience
when my imagination gets to working."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you are rather destructive," I ventured,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Now I may write a story with you and Bert for
heroes," he went on, whimsically; and when I assured
him that would be fine—</p>

<p>"But of course I'd have to kill you off at the end;
and how would you like that?"
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>p018</span></p>

<p>January 12 was Jack's thirty-first birthday. It was
also one of our numerous sailing dates, but despite the
best of intentions, we were obliged to celebrate it on
land. During my long stay in Oakland, I had ample
opportunity to get intimately acquainted with both
Jack and Mrs. London; indeed, we were all like one
big happy family. Fame and popularity have not
spoiled them. Jack is just like a big schoolboy, good-natured,
frank, generous, and Mrs. London is just a
grown-up schoolgirl. They are good comrades, always
helping each other in their work. Mrs. London
I found to be as full of grit as any of us—as we were
later to discover, there was hardly a thing on board that
any of the men could do that she couldn't do; and she
was a practised swimmer, and could ride on horseback
with grace—a gift not vouchsafed all women. And
they were both amiable Bohemians. Often, when Jack
was not busy, he and I compared notes on England.
We found that we had snooped around much the same
places in the East End of London. Immediately, I
took up his "People of the Abyss," which read almost
like a passage out of my own life. For seven days,
I had been one of those wretched people who are forever
on the move in the slums of this great city, eternally
searching for a scrap of food and for sufficient
ground-space on which to lay down their weary frames
in sleep. All was vividly described in the book. But
while the men and women of the abyss spend their
whole lives in this torment, I was there only until I <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>p019</span>
could get to Liverpool and take a cattle-boat back to
the States.</p>

<p>Once, after reading "The Sea Wolf," I told Jack
that I had always been under the impression that the
Scandinavians were of a peaceable disposition. But
he assured me that most of the events of "The Sea
Wolf" were from his own experiences—Wolf Larsen
drawn largely from life. He told me that while up
North, he had run across some of the most bloodthirsty
people he had ever seen, and they were Scandinavians.</p>

<p>Also, I got better acquainted with Tochigi and Bert
and Captain Eames. The captain was a stately old
man, grey of hair and grey of beard; and what he
didn't know about yachts was really hardly worth
knowing. In fact, the <i>Snark</i> was built according to his
plans. Captain Eames' room was next to the galley,
a place that would be almost unbearably hot in the
tropics; but of course, we planned to sleep on deck,
once we got into the real South Seas.</p>

<p>Tochigi taught me a smattering of Japanese during
the wait. True, I never mastered the language, but
I did become proficient enough to distinguish some
of the words he used when in conversation with his
Jap friends. Tochigi was a fine fellow, his manners
were the most perfect I have ever seen, and he was
clever and quick to learn. His English was limited,
but every word he did use was the right one. And
he always talked in such a low, well-modulated voice <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>p020</span>
that it was a pleasure to listen to him. We took a
great liking to each other.</p>

<p>Stolz was away quite a bit. Jack explained to me
that he was working his way through Stanford University.
If sheer strength counts for anything, Stolz
is a fellow who will never want for much. He was
always the best swimmer at the swimming pools we
went to; he could always dive from higher and turn
more somersaults in the air than anyone; and Jack
found, by experience, that Bert knew every trick in
boxing. He was really more than I expected by Jack's
description of him—an "all-around athlete."</p>

<p>Hardly a day went by without someone's rapping
at the door and asking if the <i>Snark's</i> complement was
secured, and if there was not room for just one more.
Over at the boat, I was constantly beset by cranks,
with all sorts of schemes and ideas and inventions;
and there were other people who came simply out of
curiosity, wanting to be shown over the boat. Some
of their contrivances were very ingenious. There
were "old schoolmates of Mr. London," and "girlhood
chums of Mrs. London," and there were "distant
relatives of the Londons"; some even claimed to
be special correspondents of magazines or newspapers.
But no one got aboard the <i>Snark</i> unless he had
written permission from Jack. Interest was widespread;
and shortly after, Jack increased it by delivering
a lecture on Socialism to over fifteen thousand
people in Berkeley.</p>

<p class="xpno"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>p021</p>

<p>Since the destruction of San Francisco, Chinatown
had moved to Oakland. On several occasions we went
to its theatres, and to the Chinese social gatherings.
Early in January the Chinese celebrate their New
Year. It was my good luck to see such a celebration.
On every side of me, Chinks of every age, men, women
and children, shot off fire-crackers, and flung up packs
of multi-coloured papers, perforated quite thickly with
various-shaped holes. It is their belief that the devil
has to come through all these holes before he can get
to sinners; and to stave off the enemy and render his
progress tortuous, they make the holes small and numerous.
Again, I visited secret opium dens, and saw
pasty-coloured Chinks lie for hours under the influence
of the drug. Much of the deviltry of Chinatown, however,
had come to an end with the destruction of
San Francisco, as many of the yellow rascals saw in
that wholesale catastrophe the workings of an outraged
deity.</p>

<p>As for Frisco itself, it looked hopeless. Hundreds
of tons of the wreckage had been cleared away, but
hundreds of tons still remained. Some few buildings
had already been erected. Most of them were stores,
little wooden affairs, knocked together until better
could be built. The fire and quake had ruined the
pavements, and the streets were nothing but great
pools of water and mud. A man was actually drowned
in one of these pools while walking down Market
street. There were constant deaths by accidents; <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>p022</span>
walls, frail and fissured, had a trick of collapsing
and letting down their bushels of brick and stone on
the heads of such as were in the streets; the street-car
service was badly muddled, and several persons were
killed while riding the precarious conveyances. As
I have said, wages were sky-high; yet workmen still
complained and struck for more. At the time I was
there, the bricklayers, who were getting ten dollars
a day, struck for twelve dollars and a half. Each
of the ten men working on the <i>Snark</i> received five
dollars a day, and only worked until half-past four
in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Having been practically raised in a jewellry store,
I was pretty efficient at engraving, and I employed
my talent in adding to the decorations of the <i>Snark</i>.
Just over the companionway was a big piece of finest
brass. On it I drew the word "<em><small>SNARK</small></em>" in Old English
charactery, and the carpenters filled it in with
brass-headed nails. Mrs. London was so pleased that
she later had me engrave the capstan-head. After
that, Captain Eames and I oversaw the painters while
they spread a preliminary coat of white paint over the
<i>Snark's</i> hull and picked out the name "<em><small>SNARK</small></em>" in
gold.</p>

<p>On rainy days, I stayed at the London home, reading
books and magazines. The manuscript of "The
Iron Heel," Jack's Socialistic novel, had not yet been
sent to the publishers, and I spent some exciting hours
poring over it. Jack had evidently let his imagination <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>p023</span>
have full rein in this story, for he had gone far
beyond the destruction of a mere navy, as in "Goliah,"
and had put an end to the entire city of Chicago, and
allotted to her inhabitants the most gory deaths imaginable.
But the story was one of the most impressive
I have ever read; and like Jack's Socialistic
speech before the students of a great Eastern university,
it later created a sensation.</p>

<p>And still we planned to go, and yet did not go.
We set sailing-dates and cancelled them. The time
was not yet. Puzzled by the delay, editors and publishers
with whom Jack had contracts began to write
him for explanations, but Jack could only shake his
head and wonder how he was to explain to them when
he couldn't even explain to himself. When questioned,
Captain Eames would do his best to cheer Jack
up by solemnly engaging to have the <i>Snark</i> ready for
sailing within two weeks from the date of promising,
but always the time had to be extended.</p>

<p>The <i>Snark</i> was a trim little yacht, forty-five feet
on the water-line, fifty-five over all, with a width of
fourteen feet eight inches. Her draft was seven feet
eight inches. She was of ketch-rig, which means that
she was a two-master, with the largest sail on the
forward mast—just the reverse of a schooner-rig.
Jack had seen boats of a similar design extensively
used in the Northern Seas and also on the Dogger
Bank in England; as he explained, the ketch-rig was a
compromise between the yawl and the schooner, which, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>p024</span>
while retaining the cruising virtues of the one, embraced
some of the sailing virtues of the other.</p>

<p>Never was there another such boat! Despite the
delays and the other troubles, not one of the <i>Snarkites</i>
had lost his enthusiasm. Even with all their vexations
and the ruinous expense, Mrs. London and Jack
were always smiling and happy. Often the crew
would go over the Bay and gather on the <i>Snark's</i>
deck to discuss possible improvements and to anticipate
some of the delights of the voyage that lay ahead
of us.</p>

<p>And still the <i>Snark</i> was in the building. Her lines
were marvels of strength and beauty. As an indication
of the way she was built, I need only enumerate
a few particulars as to specifications of material. Her
iron keel weighed five tons. Her greatest beam was
fifteen feet, with tumble-home sides. Her planking
was specially ordered Oregon Pine, without butts; men
were actually sent to search the Oregon pines to select
natural elbows—in other words, timbers grown by nature
in the exact form required to fit the angles of the
boat, and thus give the maximum strength of each
fibre of the wood. The planking was two and one-half
inches thick under the water-line, two inches thick
above the water-line. The ribs were of specially ordered
Indiana Oak, and were set ten inches apart.
Angle irons, the full length of the boat, connected the
ribs with the keel; these were of the best galvanised
iron, each made according to pattern. The <i>Snark's</i> <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>p025</span>
copper was the finest man-o'-war copper; its cost was
over five hundred dollars, to say nothing of the cost
of having it put on. For that matter, the boat was
copper-fastened throughout; not a nail or screw that
was not copper. The only iron used in the <i>Snark</i>
was the best galvanised iron; all other metal was brass
and bronze. She was crown-decked and flush-decked,
and had six feet of head-room below. Three water-tight
bulkheads divided her length into four water-tight
compartments.</p>

<p>"If we stove in one compartment," Jack explained
to me, "we can still bear up with the other three compartments.
I just think we'll fool some of the birds
of ill omen, after all. The <i>Snark</i> is dependable.
She's built to sail all seas, face all storms, and to go
around the world."</p>

<p>The <i>Snark</i> was intended from the first to be a sailing
vessel. But because it was felt that cases of sudden
emergency might arise, where speed was an
absolute necessity, a gasolene engine, seventy-horse-power,
was installed. Had Jack adhered to his original
idea of a forty-foot boat, there would have been no
room for such an appurtenance; but forty-five feet
gave plenty of space for both it and a small bath-room.
This latter was carefully fitted up with levers and
pumps and sea-valves, some of them of Jack's own invention.
After the engine, a dynamo was put in; and
then Jack decided to light the boat with electricity,
and to have a searchlight which would give sharp detail <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>p026</span>
at a half-mile distance. But we did not trust
entirely to electrical apparatus for illumination, for if
it should break down, it might cost us our lives. For
the binnacle light, the anchor light, and the sidelights,
which were indispensable, we supplied kerosene lamps.
Nor was the use of the engine yet exhausted. We
finally planned a giant windlass to be placed on deck,
by means of which the anchor could be hoisted without
trouble.</p>

<p>The <i>Snark</i> had neither house nor hold. The deck
was unbroken except for the hatchway forward, and
two companionways. The cockpit, large and high-railed,
so built as to be self-bailing, made a comfortable
place in which to sit, whether in fair weather or
foul. The rail, companionways, hatches, skylights,
and other finishings were of finest teak; the deck-knees,
deck-timbers, etc., of the best oak. There were
two bronze propellers; a patent steering-gear; one hundred
and five fathoms of extra heavy best galvanised
chain; two patent galvanised anchors, and one galvanised
kedge-anchor. The <i>Snark</i> carried flying-jib,
jib, fore-staysail, mainsail, mizzen and spinnaker, also
extra storm-jibs, and gaff-headed trysails. Her garboard
strake was three inches thick. In the last compartment,
in the stern of the boat, were tanks for
over a thousand gallons of gasolene. Because of the
tightness of the bulkhead which marked off this compartment,
we felt reasonably certain that none of this
very dangerous fluid could escape; and to reassure us <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>p027</span>
doubly, we were informed that the tanks themselves
were non-leakable.</p>

<p>After a time, we added more accessories to the
<i>Snark</i>. Jack ordered a five-horse-power engine, for
running pumps and dynamo; accumulators, electric
light globes, and electric fans. Then came the consideration
of navigation instruments. These consisted
of a Steering Compass, a best Standard Compass, a
best Sextant, a best Octant, a best Pelorus, a best
Barometer, a best ship's clock; and their cost was five
hundred dollars. At the last, Jack added to our equipment
what no prudent man would go to sea without—life-boats.
These were a fourteen-foot very seaworthy
launch, with gasolene engine, and an eighteen-foot
life-boat, with air-tanks and other appliances.</p>

<p>During all my stay in Oakland, I enjoyed myself
immensely. Jack was continually inviting me out to theatres,
prize-fights, and social gatherings. One of the
most amusing fights I ever saw took place in Oakland,
when a Chinaman and a negro entered the ropes and
began to bang and biff each other. The difference
in make-up between the two types was considerable,
and their methods of fighting were entirely dissimilar.
All rules of the game seemed suspended. It was give
and take, give and take; but the Chink was getting
the worst of it. Both the combatants indulged in lip-fighting,
the Chinaman execrating his dusky opponent
in strange pigeon-English, and the negro responding
with deep, throaty epithets well calculated to stir the <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>p028</span>
ire of even an equable celestial. The fight went some
rounds, with the Chink getting the worst of it all the
time. But in the end he amazed us. Venting a perfect
torrent of abuse upon the negro, he managed to
deliver almost simultaneously a blow that must have
echoed inside the coon's thick head, and a sweeping
punch in the abdomen. Both these little reminders
did the work. The negro doubled up and fell senseless
to the floor, and when the referee called ten he
was still lying there; and the Chinaman, with chest
thrown out and head erect, was strutting about the
ropes exulting over the conquest. I never could understand
it—it was such a big negro, and he went
down like a stick of wood!</p>

<p>Often, on bright days, I would take one of my
cameras—I now had four—and go over to San Francisco
to photograph streets where new buildings were
going up. Then there was the Bay—it furnished endless
material for good photographic studies, as all manner
of queer crafts were forever coming and going.
And then, the <i>Snarkites</i> would take pictures of one
another, and of the boat. Jack used to have fun
telling me that when we got to the cannibal islands,
I could take my camera and go ashore to get pictures,
and that would be Exhibit A; then, if some of the
omnivorous natives came and made a meal of me,
he would take pictures of the feast—and that would
be Exhibit B.</p>

<p>But not all my time was devoted to recreation. <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>p029</span>
That cooking proposition was lying heavy on my mind.
I couldn't forget all those fine chefs who had applied.
Going over to Frisco on the ferry, I buried my nose
assiduously in the cook-book again, searching for details
which might have escaped my previous study,
and doing my best to memorise every recipe in the
book. It was now the rainy season, and of evenings
Jack and Mrs. London and I would play cards.
Sometimes George Sterling, the poet, who lived at
Carmel-by-the-Sea, and who was a frequent caller at
the London home, would join us. Oftentimes, Jack
and I would wrangle and argue as to which of us
was the better player at hearts; but the truth of the
matter was that he and I always won and lost about
the same number of games. But though Jack and I
had these disputes, there was never any doubt as to
where poor Mrs. London stood. When it came to
playing hearts, she had undisputed title to being the
most unfortunate. A good deal of her time, however,
was spent at the typewriter; she has typed all of Jack's
manuscripts since their marriage; and just now, both
were toiling double tides, that they might have a little
work on hand. They knew that once on the ocean,
they would have a spell of seasickness during which
they could not even think of writing or typing.</p>

<p>The Oakland Elks also helped to make my stay in
their city pleasant. Before I left, they gave me a
letter to put with the one the Independence Elks had
given me, so that now I felt doubly armed with credentials. <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>p030</span>
Old Mammy Jenny, Jack's negro nurse,
gave me much valuable instruction in cooking, telling
me things that no cook-book in the world could have
told me. Jack had predicted a diet largely of fish,
when once we should be on the ocean. Mammy
Jenny told me all she knew about fish. I was considerably
relieved, too, when I discovered that most of
our provisions would be tinned, and would need little
more than warming up to make them suitable for
the table. I found great consolation in this thought.
It thinned the clouds for me. I took new lease on
life.</p>

<p>The weeks were passing, and still the <i>Snark</i> was in
the building! Jack began to grow impatient. Roscoe
Eames made promises. The old captain meant
well, but alas! his good intentions were just like all
the other good intentions. He tried his best to hurry
things along, but nothing could be induced to turn
out right. Besides, even good intentions won't build
a boat. There were times when Jack vowed he'd
sail the shell of her to Honolulu, and finish building
her there. Soon Jack's friends began to make bets,
some even wagering that the <i>Snark</i> would never sail
at all. Every time he set a sailing-date, they would
bet against it. Everybody was betting. And everybody
had quit the head-shaking and the making of
evil predictions. We were not going to the bottom
of the sea now, because we would never be on the
sea. Even the newspapers began a gentle ridicule, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>p031</span>
giving wide publicity to a poem written by Kelly, the
Sailor-Poet, in which the <i>Snark</i> was described as setting
out on her long voyage—not yet, but soon—and
meeting with all sorts of strange adventures on the
deep—not yet, but soon; and it recounted somewhat
of the things that befell the voyageurs in the various
countries they landed at—not yet, but soon. And
more letters came from editors and publishers, demanding
explanations. A big New York magazine,
for which Jack had contracted to write thirty-five
thousand words descriptive of the trip, flamboyantly
announced that it was sending Jack London, the well-known
writer, round the world, especially for itself.
This article was so worded that a reader would suppose
the magazine was paying for everything, even
for the building of the <i>Snark</i>. Immediately, everyone
who had dealings with Jack began to charge him
outrageously, explaining that the magazine had plenty
of money and that it might as well pay for its fun.
Naturally, after putting a small fortune into the boat,
and being at almost incredible trouble to plan and
outfit her, Jack was incensed. Such an article gave
to the whole thing the colour of being a cheap advertising
scheme. Even now, most people believe that the
magazine paid for everything, and that Jack received
liberal prices for the things he wrote. But such was
not the case. Jack built the boat and paid for her;
the plan was all his own, and the magazine mentioned
had nothing to do with it. For that matter, Jack <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>p032</span>
saw to it that they got no more articles from him
descriptive of the cruise of the <i>Snark</i>. He played the
free-lance, sending his "copy" wherever he chose.</p>

<p>At the beginning of March, 1907, things looked
more desperate than ever. Jack declared it was plain
the boat could never be completed in San Francisco.
"She's breaking down faster than she can be repaired,"
he said one day. "That's what comes of taking a
year for building. I'll sail her as she is, and finish
her up in Honolulu. If we don't go now, we'll never
go."</p>

<p>But immediately the <i>Snark</i> sprang a leak, and had
to be repaired before she could be moved from Anderson's
Ways. This was finally accomplished, and Jack
ordered the boat brought across the Bay to Oakland.
On a bright Saturday morning in the middle of March,
Captain Eames and Bert and I went over to Anderson's
Ways, and got aboard. At nine o'clock Captain
Eames yelled, "Let her go!" and the <i>Snark</i> slid
off her ways as easily as could be desired, and took
to the Bay with the grace of a wild water-fowl. There
was not so much as a tremble. We created a great
excitement as we were towing across the Bay to what
is known as the Oakland estuary. All the larger vessels
dipped their flags, and the smaller ones saluted
by giving three toots of the whistle. We lay anchored
in the estuary three weeks, while electricians did
the wiring and a crew of riggers and a crew of ship's
carpenters worked on the deck and the rigging. During <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>p033</span>
this time, Bert and I took turns living on board,
he sleeping aboard one night and I the next. Meanwhile,
Tochigi made himself useful at the London
home, and Mr. and Mrs. London continued to turn
out reading matter. Jack was writing his famous
tramp-stories, the ones now republished in the volume
called "The Road." Often, I sat on one side of the
table at his house, writing a letter, and he sat on the
other side, writing his stories. And as he finished
them, he read them to us; and one and all voted him
thanks for the entertainment.</p>

</div>

<p>I shall never forget the day when the sails were
unfurled for the first time. For remember, up to this
time I had never seen a real, sea-going ship under
sail, and the whole thing was mysterious to me. I
did not even know one sail from another, but I was so
proud of the little <i>Snark</i> that I got in the dingy and
made photographs of her from every conceivable position,
not caring if the canvas did hang loose and
wrinkled enough to make a sailor's heart sore. A
few days before the decks were finished, we drew up
alongside the wharf, and filled the gasolene tanks.
Next day, all hands were down early for the first trial
trip. The <i>Snark's</i> crew was aboard, and also little
Johnny London, Jack's nephew. On the trial trip we
went twelve miles out, and met as heavy a sea as will
be encountered on an ocean voyage, owing to a heavy
ground-swell coming into the Golden Gate. And we
were seasick—oh! we were seasick! Everyone <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>p034</span>
aboard was seasick except little Johnny London, and
he was not supposed to be a sailor at all.</p>

<p>But Mr. and Mrs. London declared they were
not seasick, not the least bit sick. They were just
rolled up on the deck enjoying themselves! And poor
little Tochigi said nothing, because he had nothing to
say. He did his best to smile, but force as he would,
the smile wouldn't come. I asked Jack for the honour
of bringing the <i>Snark</i> into the Golden Gate, and he
granted the request, but I noticed that he sat close by
and kept watch on me to see that I didn't run into the
Cliff House. As we came back to the starting-point,
we saw, in the mouth of the Oakland River, a mass
of freakish yellow, green and other coloured lights,
something on the order of Japanese lanterns hung
out on the lawn during a summer church-festival. We
made port that night, satisfied that we had seen something,
we knew not what. Next day, we found that
the Chinese battleship, the <i>Whang-Ho</i>, had anchored
in the harbour, and I went with Jack and Mrs. London
on board this most interesting craft. The <i>Whang-Ho</i>
was over two hundred years old, and carried wooden
cannons and torture implements of various kinds, that
had been used on captives of war in the centuries gone
by—such as a bird-cage and a back tickler.</p>

<p>During the short time that elapsed between the trial
trip and the real voyage, many interesting things occurred.
When it was my turn to sleep aboard, I would
sit for hours on the <i>Snark's</i> deck, looking out over the <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>p035</span>
Bay; when tired of that, I would go below, and lying
in my bunk, with a good-sized light over my head,
would write letters home, or read and smoke. It
seemed strange to feel the <i>Snark</i> tumbling and rolling
with the wash of the sea. Sometimes it seemed as if
she were tugging at her moorings, longing to be off
on the long, long cruise. Because of her smallness,
she responded to the heave and lunge of the ocean
much more freely than would the ordinary ship.
Even a tug-boat, passing many feet away, would jostle
the <i>Snark</i> with its wash. Lying in my bunk, I could
look up through a skylight and see the masts, and,
higher yet, the scintillating stars. At last, after all my
hopes and fears, after all the vexatious troubles and delays,
the dream was coming true! The time was near
at hand, when we should really shake the dust of California
from our feet, and ride the little <i>Snark</i> round
and about the earth!</p>

<p>And then, crash! bump! bump! the dream was rudely
shattered. The noise was on every side of me. Two
large lumber-scows had dragged their anchors and
laid up against the sides of the <i>Snark</i>, nearly making
a sandwich of our little boat. Nothing could be done.
They bumped away at the <i>Snark</i> all night long, and
when morning came the rail was flattened two inches
on one side and bulged out rather more than two
inches on the other side; and wherever she is, the
<i>Snark</i> is lop-sided to this day.</p>

<p>On another night, when I was alone on board, I <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>p036</span>
went to my bunk early and fell asleep. About three
in the morning I was awakened by the sound of the
anchor-chain paying out of the hawsepipes, and I
rushed up on deck to see what was happening. A
terrible storm was raging, and the boat was just like
a cork, bobbing and rolling on the waves. I made
fast the chains and went back to bed. At four-thirty
I again started up from my bunk. Something told me
that all was not well with the <i>Snark</i>. When I went
on deck, I found the boat was within a hundred yards
of a pile wharf, heading straight for it, and travelling
fast. I knew the anchor had slipped, and if the boat
got on the piles it would be good-bye to our cruise.
It was blowing a gale, and the rain was coming down
in sheets. I lowered the kedge-anchor and stopped
the boat for the time being, but knew she would not
hold long. I ran below to start the engine, but could
not do so because one of the machinists had taken it
apart in one place to clean it, and so put it out of commission.
I worked for half an hour, with desperate
haste, to put the engine into running order; then
started her, and went on deck. The kedge-anchor
was now slipping, and again we started for the piles.
Running to the cockpit, I turned on the propeller, and
away went the boat out into the Bay, with the anchors
dragging. When I stopped her, she started drifting
back; and so I had it, back and forth, toward the piles
and then out into the Bay, all the rest of the night,
until eight o'clock brought the workmen in a rowboat. <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>p037</span>
The fight for life had continued nearly four terrible
hours, but it had been worth it. About twenty-five
vessels, many of them larger than the <i>Snark</i>, had been
wrecked in that storm. Mr. London's remarks to me
that morning were quite gratifying, and I felt I had
made up for my mistake in letting the lumber-scows
bump the <i>Snark</i> lop-sided.</p>

<p>There were always so many water-thieves around
the Bay that it was necessary to keep a sharp lookout.
One night when I was in my bunk I heard a noise, and
crept up in my stocking feet to the deck, armed with
a big 38-calibre revolver. But I could find no cause
for alarm. The night was dark. Far over the Bay
was San Francisco, from which the busy ferry-boats
were plying, back and forth; and every few minutes,
a revolving light from a lighthouse stationed on a
nearby rock flooded the deck, making everything
bright as day. As a rule, there were a number of
large vessels, from various ports, within a short distance
of the <i>Snark</i>, and I could see their lights, and
hear their sailors singing as they worked. During the
day, I would go aboard these ships and engage the
sailors in conversation, as I was always desirous of
hearing something about the places which later I would
see.</p>

<p>The galley was now very nearly finished, and many
hours I spent in it practising cooking. I made bread
and cakes and pies, and fed them to the workmen.
These products were of varying degrees of excellence, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>p038</span>
but the workmen seemed to be able to get away with
them, and so I baked all they could eat. I don't believe
the men's digestions were very seriously deranged,
either. Jack bought a bread-mixing machine
a few days later, and then I was able to do in about
thirty minutes what before I could only do in several
hours. Before the buying was finished, there were
few luxuries or facilities we did not have aboard the
<i>Snark</i>.</p>

<p>Once when I was in the galley, the boat was invaded
by the Famous Fraternity. The Famous Fraternity
was a group of celebrated authors and artists, all hailing
from California and most of them resident there.
Among those who came were George Sterling, the
man whom the Londons had pronounced one of the
greatest of living poets, Martinez, the artist, Dick Partington,
another artist, Johannes Reimers, writer, and
Jimmie Hopper, famous first as a football hero and
then as a writer of short stories, and others, whose
names I have now forgotten. I did my very best to
prepare them a good dinner; and if their expressions
of satisfaction were any indication, I succeeded. I
served up a whole gunny-sack full of steamed mussels,
and some of my bread, which one and all declared the
finest they had ever tasted. They almost beat the
workmen eating. I began to think more than ever
of my prowess as a cook. In such a glow of pride as
possessed me, my misgivings disappeared utterly.</p>

<p>Now let me skim lightly over the troubles that followed <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>p039</span>
up to the very day of our sailing. I don't want
this narrative to shape itself as a mere record of mishaps
and vexations, for such a record would not reflect
things truly. Taken all in all, our troubles were
as nothing at all to our delights. But truth compels
me to say that in the month preceding our departure,
things that before had gone casually and desultorily
wrong seemed to take on fresh energy in ill-doing,
and to go systematically and diabolically wrong. Had
a malevolent intelligence been directing events, they
could not have been more discomfiting to the impatient
crew of the <i>Snark</i>. When the boat was nearly ready
for our sailing, she was placed upon the ways for a
final overhauling. The ways spread, and the <i>Snark</i>
fell stern-first into the mud. In the crash, the bedplate
of the big engine splintered, and the engine, in
falling, smashed some of its connections. When the
windlass was tried out, its gears ground each other
flat, and the castings which connected it with the engine
broke into fragments. It took two steam-tugs a week,
pulling on the <i>Snark</i> every high tide night and day,
to get her out of the mud and into the water alongside
the Oakland City Wharf. We gave up all hope of
both engine and windlass until we should have reached
Honolulu; and we packed away the broken parts as
best we could, and lashed the engine tight to its foundations.</p>

<p>April 18 was now set for the sailing. We began
provisioning and buying all kinds of photographic supplies, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>p040</span>
done up in tropical form—that is, with the film
wrapped in tin-foil and sealed in tins, and the paper
triple-wrapped and protected with foil. There were
a thousand and one things bought toward the last,
which it is needless to enumerate here. We bought
clothing, and we bought fishing tackle, and harpoons,
and guns, and pistols, and we bought paper, paper for
Jack's writing, and paper for the typewriter, hundreds
of reams of it. I spent a whole day packing this
paper behind sliding panels in the two staterooms
forward, which were set aside for Jack and Mrs. London.
We spent money like water; it took dray after
dray to bring down to the wharf the things we purchased.
Then there were dray-loads of the things
brought from the London home, wood and coal, provisions,
vegetables, blankets, other things, and still
other things, and above all, books—five hundred of
them, on every conceivable topic, selected from
Jack's library of ten thousand volumes. The <i>Snark</i>
was fairly ballasted with books. Mrs. London busied
herself in directing the work, and showed a knowledge
of stevedoring that astonished us. At last, after hours
of toil and sweat, everything was safely aboard. But
so much still had to be done that we decided to put
off leaving until Sunday, April 21.</p>

<p>And then came one of the worst blows of all. It
was Saturday afternoon, and Jack and Bert and I were
on the <i>Snark</i>, packing things away. All about us, on
the wharf, were reporters and photographers and sightseers. <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>p041</span>
Jack had brought his checque-book and several
thousand dollars in paper money and gold, and was
wishing Roscoe would hurry and come with the accounts
of the various firms to which he was indebted,
that he might make payment. Without any warning
whatever, a United States marshal stepped aboard
and pasted a little five-by-seven slip of paper to one
of the masts. It was an attachment, issued from the
office of the Marshal of the United States, of the
Northern District of California, and stated that any
person who removed or attempted to move the
schooner-yacht, <i>Snark</i>, without the written permission
of the marshal, would be prosecuted to the full extent
of the law.</p>

<p>We were all astounded. What could it mean?
Jack hastened over to San Francisco to investigate.
We had planned to sail at eleven o'clock on the morrow,
so haste was imperative. After several hours
Jack came back, accompanied by Mrs. London, and
told us what had happened.</p>

<p>It seemed that a man named L. H. Sellers, of San
Francisco, who was a ship-chandler, had placed the attachment
on the <i>Snark</i>. Jack owed him something
like two hundred and fifty dollars, and Sellers' account
was one of those Jack had intended to close that very
day.</p>

<p>"It is just a petty trick of a tradesman in a panic,"
Jack declared, as he gazed at the writ of attachment
pasted on the mast of the <i>Snark</i>. "But it will not <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>p042</span>
delay me one minute in getting away on the trip I have
planned. If the bill were one thousand dollars, I would
pay it and feel the same way about it. I have done
several thousands of dollars' worth of business with
this L. H. Sellers, and with other firms, and this is
the first time I have ever been attached. I do not dispute
the bill of Sellers. I owe the claim, and intended
to pay it. I never received a bill for the amount of
the attachment, and suppose that when L. H. Sellers
learned that I was about to sail, he became panic-stricken
at the thought of not receiving what was due
him. I have been endeavouring to communicate with
some officer of the United States district court and
settle the matter as soon as possible."</p>

<p>But the matter was not so easily to be settled.
Someone had spread the word around that Jack London
and his crew were preparing to sneak out of the
Bay that night, leaving the statute of limitations to
cancel all debts. Representatives of three other big
firms, with claims aggregating nearly three thousand
dollars, descended upon the <i>Snark</i>, and Jack promptly
paid them. After that came a drove of smaller tradesmen—"All
in a panic," Jack said—and each and
every one received his money without delay.</p>

<p>Jack sent agents and lawyers all over San Francisco
and Oakland, but the United States marshal could not
be found. Then a search was made for the United
States judge, but he, too, had disappeared; and after
all hope was given up of discovering them, Jack set out <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>p043</span>
to find Mr. L. H. Sellers, but Mr. L. H. Sellers was
nowhere to be found, nor Mr. Sellers' attorney. It
was plain that the embargo could not be lifted that
night.</p>

<p>A little old man, a deputy United States marshal,
had been left in charge; and never did miser guard
his treasure as that little old man guarded the <i>Snark</i>.
He stayed on her constantly, to see that Jack London
did not whisk her out of the Bay and start on the trip.
Of course, we did not sail Sunday, April 21, as planned.
The little old man would not allow it. The funny part
of it was that Jack was obliged to pay this deputy
marshal three dollars a day for his zealous custodianship
of the <i>Snark</i>. But the old man earned it. He
stuck to the boat like glue, even going without meals
that the vigil might not be interrupted.</p>

<p>Saturday night all the <i>Snarkites</i> walked out on an opposite
pier to take a look at the <i>Snark</i> and to make
plans. Jack and Mrs. London were still smiling. It
seemed impossible to dash their spirits.</p>

<p>From where we stood, the <i>Snark</i> showed up bravely.
She was a little floating palace. Jack could not refrain
from bragging to Mrs. London about her
bow.</p>

<p>"Isn't it a beauty?" he asked again and again.
"That bow was made to punch storms with! It
laughs at the sea! Not a drop can come over her!
We'll be as dry and comfortable as any craft afloat,
with such a bow as that!" And Mrs. London would <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>p044</span>
laugh her assent, and find new virtues in the boat and
in that bow.</p>

<p>"Well," I said at last. "We'll get away Tuesday,
anyway."</p>

<p>"Yes, we'll get away Tuesday. Think of that!"
Mrs. London cried in response. "It will be worth
all the trouble, and all the expense. Once we're out
on the ocean, we'll forget all our little worries, the
accidents, and the Sellerses, and all the rest. Glorious?
Glorious doesn't express it."</p>

<p>"And think of what we can do when we get the
engine to running again," Jack went on. "Think of
the inland work. With such an engine, there isn't a
river in the world with current stiff enough to baffle
us. We can see so much more by inland voyaging
than we could by merely hanging around ports. Think
of the people, and the natural scenery! The things
we won't know about the various countries through
which we pass won't be worth knowing."</p>

<p>"That reminds me," I broke in. "What do you
think you'll write about?"</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"Well, if we're boarded by pirates and fight it out
until our deck becomes a shambles, I don't think I'll
write about it. And if we're wrecked at sea, and are
driven by starvation into eating one another I'll keep
it quiet for the sake of our relatives. And if we're
killed and eaten by cannibals, of course I shan't let
the American public get an inkling of it."</p>

<p class="xpno"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>p045</p>

<p>"You won't starve," I assured him. "Think of
all the food we have aboard—over three months'
supply. And think of your cook! No, you will never
starve aboard the <i>Snark</i>."</p>

<p>"The thing that's worrying me," Bert here broke
in, "is how we're going to find room to get around
on the boat. Since that windlass was set up, and the
launch and life-boat lashed on deck, there is hardly
room to turn around in." And Tochigi, who was always
very quiet, said nothing at all.</p>

<p>For days, Jack and Captain Eames had been engaged
in one of the most laughable arguments I have ever
heard. Roscoe Eames stoutly maintained that the
earth is concave of surface, and that we would all sail
round on the inside of a hollow sphere; while Jack,
who was willing to stick to orthodox cosmology, just
as stoutly maintained that Roscoe was mistaken, and
that we would sail round on the outside. Each had a
number of proofs, which he adduced in the argument;
and neither was to be shaken in his confidence. To this
day, I think they hold divergent opinions on the subject.
Captain Eames was also a vegetarian; and it
was this fact that made me wonder how he was to get
along satisfactorily on the <i>Snark</i>.</p>

<p>Though Jack had answered my question jestingly,
I knew that he contemplated writing an extended series
of articles on the home-life of the various peoples
among whom we were to sojourn. He would treat
of their domestic problems; social structures; problems <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>p046</span>
of living; cost of living as compared with the cost
in the United States; education; opportunities for advancement;
general tone of peoples; culture; morals;
religion; how they amuse themselves; marriage and
divorce problems; housekeeping, and a hundred other
topics.</p>

<p>When we left the wharf that night, we felt more
cheerful than ever. Mrs. London was right. That
boat was well worth all the trouble and expense.
"Barring wreck and worms," said Jack, "she'll be
sailing the seas a hundred years from now."</p>

<p>All day Monday we worked on the <i>Snark</i>, besieged
constantly by reporters and photographers. Jack
paid Mr. L. H. Sellers his two hundred and fifty dollars,
and lifted the embargo. In the afternoon we
were towed out in the Bay, and an expert adjusted our
compasses and other instruments for us. It was essential
that these be in proper trim, the more so as
not one of us knew anything about navigation except
Captain Eames, and even his knowledge was of the
experimental sort. Jack declared that the rest of us
could learn after we were afloat. Thousands of people
visited the wharf that day to take a look at us;
and the photographers were busy taking snap-shots
of the boat. Out in the Bay, we had with us a reporter
for the Hearst papers. When he left, he took
with him my last message ashore, a telegram to be
sent to Independence announcing the imminence of our <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>p047</span>
departure. We worked all that night, stowing and
packing, and getting things shipshape for our cruise
to Hawaii. At high tide the next morning we were
to up-anchor and away.</p>

<p>Daylight broke at last. That 23rd of April, 1907,
I shall never forget. Thousands came down to the
wharf to bid us good-bye and to wish us a pleasant and
successful voyage. Photographers from a popular
western magazine took what they announced would be
the last views of the <i>Snark</i> and her crew. Among the
dozens of telegrams I received was one from an Independence
friend, which read: "Good-bye. Hope
I may see you again." Surrounded by hundreds of
people who were prophesying that we would never
reach Honolulu, this telegram had a rather gruesome
sound to me. Strangely enough, I never did see this
friend again. I did not meet my death in the water,
but he did. He drowned in one of the rivers near
Independence.</p>

<p>Among those who came down to say the farewells
were many members of the Bohemian Club of San
Francisco, to which Jack belonged. There were
writers and artists and newspaper men. George Sterling
and James Hopper were on hand, as was also Martinez,
the artist. Mrs. London's friends came in a
body. Then there were Oakland Elks, and San Francisco
Elks, and friends of Tochigi, and Bert's friends,
and all the friends of the Eames', and others who came <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>p048</span>
merely out of curiosity to see the world-famous author
and his crew sail off in one of the most unique little
boats that ever rode the waves.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful, bright, sunshiny day when we
passed out of the Golden Gate, with hundreds of
whistles tooting us a farewell salute, passed the Seal
Rocks, and turned her bow to the westward. My
duties on the smallest boat, with only one or two exceptions,
that ever crossed the Pacific Ocean, had begun;
but instead of getting busy cooking meals, I sat
in the stern looking gloomily toward the land, which
was the last I would see of good old American soil for
nearly three years. I was thinking of the friends and
the home I was leaving, and wondering if we were
really bound for the bottom of the sea as so many
had foretold; and I could not altogether down a feeling
that I would just a little rather be on the full-rigged
ship that passed us on her way into the harbour. But
on the <i>Snark</i> I was and on the <i>Snark</i> I must remain.
Gloomy dreams soon ended, and we settled down to
life on the high seas.</p>

<p>So it was that we put forth into the wide Pacific, in
a mere cork of a boat, without a navigator, with no
engineer, no sailors, and for that matter, no cook.
This lack of a cook did not bother much just then,
however, for soon we were all too seasick to care to eat.</p>

<p>When night came, land was out of sight, darkness
wrapped us about on every side, and the <i>Snark</i> rose
and fell rhythmically, the sport of every wave.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>p049</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III<br />
ON THE HIGH SEAS</h2>
<p class="toclink"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></p>
<p>After we passed out of the Golden Gate and headed
seaward on our voyage, there followed twenty-seven
days that are almost beyond description. One cannot
describe them by comparing them with anything
else, for probably since the world began there has
never been anything quite like them. Suffice it to say
that these twenty-seven days were the most wild and
chaotic that human beings ever experienced.</p>

<p>We headed south, hoping to pick up with the northeast
trades. The port for which we were making lay
approximately twenty-one hundred miles away, in a
straight line. But while we ignored the straight line,
and were in no particular hurry, we nevertheless fairly
raced over the water. We couldn't help ourselves.
The <i>Snark</i> tore along before the wind despite all
handicaps.</p>

<p>"I wish some of the crack sailors of the Bohemian
Club could see us now!" Jack exclaimed, exultantly.
"They said the <i>Snark</i> could not run—that her
lines wouldn't permit it. Well, here's something to
make them sit up and revise their criticism—but unfortunately
they can't see!"</p>

<p>The water began to get rough. A queer sensation
kept asserting itself right in the region of my stomach, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>p050</span>
and I knew only too well what it portended. As the
moments went by, this feeling recurred more frequently,
each attack a little more aggravated than the
one before it. The sea grew boisterous. It began
to lash itself into crested waves.</p>

<p>The galley or kitchen of the <i>Snark</i> was tucked away
to one side, and was not large enough for two small
men to enter, close the door, and then turn around.
As a matter of fact, if I was handling a dish of any
size, I had to back out of the door to turn around, myself.
For the first meal, I decided that I would try
some fried onions, a nice roast with dressing, some
vegetables, and some pudding; so I got out about a
half-peck of onions, and by the time I had finished
peeling those onions in that little galley, I decided that
onions were all that was needed for that meal. Did
you ever peel onions in a kitchen cupboard? That
is practically what I was doing. My eyes were watering
so that I couldn't see, and my nostrils and throat
were burning so that I couldn't talk. The entire crew
was kind enough to say that they liked onions, anyway.</p>

<p>Tochigi served the dinner, and we all ate. Then
I made for my bunk, feeling, as Captain Eames put
it, "rather white around the gills." As soon as
Tochigi had served the dinner, he got out his flute,
played the most mournful piece I have ever heard,
and as the last note died away, rushed precipitately
up on deck and relieved his deathly sickness at the rail. <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>p051</span>
Mrs. London speedily joined him. But Jack and Bert
and Captain Eames were as yet unaffected.</p>

<p>The boat was leaking like a sieve. Yes, the <i>Snark</i>,
the famous <i>Snark</i>, that had cost thirty thousand dollars,
that had been built by expert shipbuilders, and
that was declared to be the tightest craft afloat,
leaked! The sides leaked, the bottom leaked; we
were flooded. Even the self-bailing cockpit quickly
filled with water that could find no outlet. Our gasolene,
stored in non-leakable tanks and sealed behind
an air-tight bulkhead, began to filter out, so that we
hardly dared to strike a match. The air was full of
the smell of it. I got up from my bunk, staggering
sick. Bert started the five-horse-power engine, which
controlled the pumps, and by this means managed to
get some of the sea out of our quarters below.</p>

<p>At intervals, I was obliged to spend some necessary
moments at the rail. The rail was only a foot high;
one was obliged to crouch down on deck, clinging
tightly, and lean far out, confronted ever by the stern
face of the waves. The unutterable, blind sickness
of such moments it is beyond the province of words
to portray.</p>

<p>Never had I known anything like it! My head
ached, my stomach ached, every muscle in my body
ached. There were times when it seemed impossible
that I should live. When the sickness was at its
height, I was blind, deaf, and—need I say it?—dumb.
All stabilities were shattered. The universe <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>p052</span>
itself was rocking and plunging through the cold depths
of space. And then, for a brief instant, the sickness
would subside, and sight and speech and hearing return,
and I knew I was on the <i>Snark</i>, the plaything of
the waves, and that I, the most desperate of living
creatures, was gurgling and babbling my troubles to the
uncaring sea. Later, it was laughable, but ye gods! at
the time laughter was a stranger to my soul.</p>

<p>It did not ease matters much to discover that the
water pouring into the boat had ruined the tools in
the engine room, and spoiled a good part of our three
months' provisions in the galley. Our box of oranges
had been frozen; our box of apples was mostly spoiled;
the carrots tasted of kerosene; the turnips and beets
were worthless; and last, but not least, our crate of
cabbages was so far gone in decay that it had to be
thrown overboard. As for our coal, it had been delivered
in rotten potato-sacks, and in the swinging and
thrashing of the ship had escaped, and was washing
through the scuppers into the ocean. We found that
the engine in the launch was out of order, and that our
cherished life-boat leaked as badly as did the <i>Snark</i>.
In one respect, however, I was especially marked out
for discomfort. I had the misfortune to be somewhat
taller than any of the rest; and so low was the ceiling of
the galley and the staterooms downstairs that I could
never stand upright, but was obliged to stoop. The
only place where I could be really comfortable was on <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>p053</span>
deck, and even here things were so tightly packed
that there never was room for a promenade.</p>

<p>We didn't discover all our handicaps at once. It
took about a week for us to see all there was to see, and
to get acquainted with our little floating home. One of
our greatest drawbacks was the fact that never for a
moment could we let go of one hold unless we were
assured of another. To have let go would have meant
being jerked off our feet and thrown sprawling until
we fetched up against something stout enough to check
the fall. Circus gymnastics is as nothing compared
with it. I have seen many acrobatic feats, but nothing
resembling in mad abandon the double handspring
Mrs. London turned one day when her hand missed
its hold and she landed down the companionway in
the middle of the table, on top of a dinner which I
had just cooked, and which Tochigi was serving.</p>

<p>Toward evening of the first day, we passed a
steamer, but could not make her out. The air grew
chilly as night set in, and the flying spray in the air
made it worse. Our dynamo would not work, so we
had nothing but the kerosene lamps to depend on for
light. After considerable difficulty, we got the mizzen
mainstay and jibsails set, and such of us as were not
on watch turned in. Mrs. London's watch was from
eight till ten; then I relieved her from ten till twelve,
and was in turn relieved by Tochigi.</p>

<p>Bert and Tochigi and I occupied one cabin. Mine <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>p054</span>
was an upper bunk; Tochigi's bunk was beneath mine,
and Bert slept across the room. Captain Eames had
a room of his own, but just now he was unable to
sleep in it, for the water and gasolene drove him out.
(Captain Eames waxed facetious, and always referred
to his room as "the gasolene chamber.") Each bunk
had upholstered springs and mattresses and was fitted
with an electric light globe and a fan. Such of the
crew as were sleeping had to be packed tight in their
bunks with pillows to prevent their being tossed across
the room.</p>

<p>On the morning of the second day, Jack awoke me
at six-thirty, and I got breakfast. He was the only
one who could eat. Not much wind was stirring, but
a big swell was running. The <i>Snark</i> was still racing.</p>

<p>"I gave no thought to speed in building the <i>Snark</i>,"
Jack said that morning. "Only safety and comfort
were considered. But if the <i>Snark</i> has fallen below
our expectations in some things, she has certainly exceeded
them in that."</p>

<p>I hazarded a guess. "At this rate, we will compress
seven years' travelling into a few months."</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll find a means to stop her," he was confident,
and went upstairs to the wheel.</p>

<p>And now occurred another remarkable thing. Jack
started to heave-to, in other words, to place the <i>Snark</i>
bow-on to the wind. The first gust of a gale had
started, and the <i>Snark</i>, with flying-jib, jib and mizzen
taken in, and reefs in the big mainsail and the fore-staysail, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>p055</span>
was rolling in the trough, the most dangerous
position in which a ship can be placed. As Jack put
the wheel down to heave-to, the flying jib-boom poked
its nose into the water, and broke clean off. Jack put
the wheel hard down, and the <i>Snark</i> never responded,
but remained in the trough. The ship alternately
buried her rails in the stiff sea. The mainsail was
flattened down, but without avail. Then Bert tried
slacking it off, but that had no effect whatever. Hoping
to bring her bow up to the wind, they took in all
canvas but the storm trysail on the mizzen, but still
the <i>Snark</i> rolled in the trough. Jack declared he had
never heard of such a thing before.</p>

<p>"And we must even lose faith in the <i>Snark's</i> wonderful
bow," he said, regretfully. "It won't heave-to."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I had gone back to my bunk, sicker
than ever. Tochigi lay prostrate, seeing and hearing
nothing. He had not moved since yesterday. Mrs.
London and Bert and Captain Eames were able to
stay on deck, but even they had occasional tremors and
sudden rushes of sickness. Once, in the afternoon,
I tried to fool my stomach by eating a cracker, but
it was no go. By this time, the floors of stateroom and
galley were slushy with water, and all the time more
was seeping in. Bert had pumped it out yesterday, but
already it was up to our knees. My sickness increased
whenever I heard it swashing around on the
floor. <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_56"
 id="Page_56"></a>p056</span></p>

<p>Night was coming on, a night of storm and wind.
The <i>Snark</i> was creaking and groaning, and still in
that most dangerous of all positions, the trough.
Jack got out his patent sea-anchor, warranted not to
dive, and trailed it out a few yards into the sea, then
made fast. Almost the minute the line drew taut, the
anchor dived. The <i>Snark</i> still raced. Then Jack
drew the anchor in, and tied a big timber to it. This
time it floated, but it had no deterrent effect at all.
The <i>Snark</i> continued to race. Do what they would,
the little boat went right ahead, and remained in the
trough of the sea, all the while pitching like a cork.</p>

<p>On Thursday, I prepared only two meals. Bert
and Captain Eames and Jack ate. Tochigi lay motionless
in his bunk, looking like one dead, and I made
for my bunk at the first opportunity. Mrs. London
was taken desperately sick, and we saw little of her
that day. We were still heading south. Before leaving
the Golden Gate, Jack had told us of the flying
fish that we were sure to pick up with as soon as we
got out to sea, and of the dolphin and porpoises and
bonita, to say nothing of sharks. But despite his prediction,
we saw nothing at all. The <i>Snark</i> headed
farther and farther south, the days grew warmer and
warmer, but never a shark nor porpoise nor even a
flying fish showed up. On Sunday, April 28, we made
one hundred and ten miles. The galley floor burst
from the pressure of water, and we had a hard time
repairing it. For days I wore thigh-boots in cooking, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>p057</span>
and we kept the five-horse-power engine busy with the
pumps. On April 30, one week after leaving Frisco,
things looked worse than ever, and we were still sick.
There were times when only Jack or Captain Eames
could eat anything.</p>

</div>

<p>We all tried to keep one another cheered up as
much as possible. Anyone who has been seasick can in
some measure appreciate our predicament. There is
something amusing about seasickness—when somebody
else is afflicted. At first, you fear you will die;
then, after it has a good hold on you, you fear you
won't die; and you feel that you are all stomach, and
that that stomach is emptying itself faster than it could
possibly be filled. The person who is not actually in
the throes of seasickness can have no sympathy with
the person who is so afflicted. I used to go up to Mrs.
London when she was at the wheel, and ask her if I
should not prepare for her dinner a nice piece of fat
pork with a string tied to it. The effect was magical.
Immediately, she would clap her hands over her mouth
and make for the rail. There is something infectious
about seasickness. I would have to go join her myself,
and sometimes Jack would come with us.</p>

<p>On one occasion, I almost gave up, and expressed
to Jack the wish that I could see land. He replied:
"Never mind, Martin, we are not over two miles from
land now;" and when I asked him which way, he said:
"Straight down, Martin, straight down."</p>

<p>One whole day I slept, or tried to sleep, in the life-boat. <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>p058</span>
But the life-boat was a joke. By this time we
realised that if a really severe storm should strike us,
the life-boat would be the first thing to go, and our
only resource in case of foundering would be the
launch, which is to say, that had the <i>Snark</i> gone down,
we would have gone down with it. So our only hope
was in fair weather and the pumps.</p>

<p>The bath-room had long since gone out of commission.
The first day out, the big iron levers that
controlled the sea-valves and the bath-pumps broke
into splinters. Jack's heart was sore at this, for he
had planned that bath-room carefully, and had been
to much expense in fitting it up. Another thing that
would have dashed most skippers' spirits was the fact
that the specially ordered planking from Puget Sound,
warranted to have no butts, was literally crowded with
butts. But Jack did not let any of these things trouble
him much; he merely commented on them, and then
set himself to make the best of the voyage. Luckily,
we were not becalmed. Had this misfortune been
added to the rest, it might have taken us sixty days
or more to reach Honolulu.</p>

<p>A little over a week out, a gale struck us, and carried
away the jib and staysail. Everybody worked;
the boat was creaking and groaning, water spouting
in everywhere, and the cockpit filled with water. The
engine wouldn't work, and nothing else worked. This
gale was a wonderful experience for me. The little
boat would go down in the trough of the wave, and <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>p059</span>
I would gaze up and see the water coming in a massive
cone, a million tons of water, looking a hundred feet
high. It seemed to overtop our mainmast several
times and more. I felt absolutely certain that when
that mass of water hit us, we would be gone; but
each time our stout little craft would climb the side of
the wave until we reached the top, and then would
start down the opposite side so rapidly that it produced
that peculiar feeling one experiences when going down
a Shoot-the-Chutes or the steep incline of a Roller-Coaster.
In fact, seasickness is nothing more than
this sensation aggravated to a point where it is painful.
We were pitched around with great violence—sometimes
we would be away over on one side until the
water came pouring in the scuppers; and again, the
boat would rush downward at such a rate of speed
that I just knew we were making for that bottom Mr.
London had spoken of; then we would go up again,
each time to my surprise, because I was satisfied that
we were as good as dead at least twice to each wave
we rode. During this storm, the thought came to me
that just a year before, on May 1, I was on a big
cattle-steamer, going east on the Atlantic; and here I
was, a year later, on a fish-bobber, in the middle of the
Pacific, going—where? But the sea was not in existence
that could swamp us. When the storm broke
away the next day, and the sun arose bright and clear,
everyone seemed to feel better and to take renewed
interest in life. <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_60"
 id="Page_60"></a>p060</span></p>

<p>We had not been long out of port before we became
convinced that we had no navigator aboard. Captain
Eames was supposed to be the navigator, but the navigation
of a small boat is difficult and Jack had to assist
him in the work. On certain days we made splendid
headway and seemed to have covered considerable
distance but our observations and markings on the chart
showed that we had not done nearly as well as we supposed.
On the other hand, there were days when it
had been practically calm, and our records would show
that we had fairly whirled over the water. The principles
of navigation are fairly simple—and misunderstood
by most people. Before we had reached
Honolulu, everyone in the boat was navigating, except
Tochigi. Of course, most of our mistakes had
their roots in the fact that the boat's tossing threw
our observations out of line, and our eyes were rather
too near to the water. Of course, too, our record of
time on board was sadly perturbed, despite our turning
the ship's clock back about ten minutes each day.</p>

<p>And still we saw no fish of any sort. Jack could
not understand it. He had been in these latitudes before,
and always had seen porpoises and dolphins and
flying fish, as well as sharks and bonita. But the
ocean was absolutely bare in every direction. We
were in a watery desert. It was not until we got to
latitude 19° that we saw the first flying fish, and he
was all by himself.</p>

<p>On Thursday, May 2, we felt that we were certainly <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>p061</span>
in the trade winds. We went dead ahead of the breeze,
with all the sails set except the mizzen, and doing
what old sailors, men of forty years on the sea, declare
cannot be done—racing along with no one at
the wheel. We simply set the wheel over to suit
the wind, without even lashing it; and then all went
below to supper, and to play cribbage. By this time
I had learned a number of new dishes. Tochigi
showed me the Japanese way of preparing rice, and
it beat anything I had yet cooked. All were feeling
in high spirits. The sickness had left us, and the
boat looked tidier than at any time since leaving Frisco,
for we had spent the day in scrubbing the floors, and
generally cleaning things up.</p>

<p>When it came to the actual test, we found that the
provisions of the <i>Snark</i> were not exactly adapted to that
kind of trip. The duty of provisioning the boat had
been left to Mrs. London and myself, and I fear that
in the buying we lost all sense of proportion. We had
bought an enormous crate of cabbages (which, as I
have said, speedily found its way into the sea), and
a whole case of lemons; and I had made out the list
of spices and seasonings, all of which were purchased,
enough to run the Delmonico for a year. The amount
of pepper we had aboard would last a good-sized
family through several lifetimes. When we completed
the voyage, we had pepper to throw overboard,
and I'll bet the fish in that vicinity have been coughing
and sneezing ever since. <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_62"
 id="Page_62"></a>p062</span></p>

<p>But the cooking was a reasonably easy proposition,
because most of the time over half the crew didn't care
for anything to eat, and the others were kind enough
to say that they particularly liked my method of preparing
only one dish at a meal, and depending on the
can-opener for the rest. And observe the security of
my position—they could not fire me and hire a new
cook, so they had to like it or do without eating.</p>

<p>The galley had a Primus kerosene stove, which
burned without odour. On the galley shelves were all
sorts of pots and pans, bottles, tins, and utensils. For
each and every separate thing, a hole had been made
in the shelves, of just the right size and shape, so
that nothing could topple out. On the stove, there
were racks to hold the skillets and pots and pans
while I cooked; but the pots and pans had a trick of
jumping out of their racks and banging down into
the bilge-water on the floor. And what didn't leap
off the stove slopped and splashed all over the galley
and the cook. As for myself, I was flung back and
forth from one side of the galley to the other, until
my back was a mass of bruises from bumping against
the bulkhead.</p>

<p>A few extracts from the diary I kept during this
cruise to Hawaii will throw an interesting light on
how we lived aboard the <i>Snark</i>. The entries in this
diary reflect my feelings better than I could recollect
them after the lapse of several years.</p>

<div class="head3">
<h3>May 2, 1907.</h3>—I feel much better to-day.
Am trying <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_63"
id="Page_63"></a>p063</span> to clean up galley. It is getting
warmer. No wind scarcely—making about two knots. I've changed
watches with Bert, so now I have from four to six in the morning.
Mrs. London is certainly a brick—weighs only one hundred and
ten pounds, but bears up wonderfully, and is everywhere at once.
The last few days I've cooked with my boots on. Mrs. L. helps.
Floor of galley only about two feet above inside bottom of <i>Snark</i>.
Down below, water moves freely from one air-tight compartment to
the other. Will we ever reach Honolulu alive?</div>

<p>Evening.—I feel fine. So do all. Even Tochigi
is smiling again, and that's nuff said. It's the prettiest
evening I've seen in a long time. Bert, who is engineer,
finds the dynamo won't work, so he is filling
the oil lamps again. Just think of it—we have 19 big
electric lights on the boat, and a searchlight, and not
one of them working! Jack and Mrs. London are
playing cribbage in the cockpit. Tochigi washing
clothes over the rail. Ocean calm, except for the
swell that is always felt. We had a fine time at supper,
telling stories, and joking with one another.
Well, I'm going to turn in. My bunk is five feet five
inches long, two feet wide, and one foot six inches
from the ceiling, but I feel as good in it as on feathers.</p>

<p>Queer that we have seen no fish. Jack can't account
for it. Mr. Eames has gone back to his room—he
was run out a few days ago by gasolene leaking
under his bunk. Water still spouting in. Pumps <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>p064</span>
needed. Many of Tochigi's books are ruined by being
water-soaked. Mrs. London has bad headache,
and so have I, but a little sleep will cure that. So
here's for the bunk.</p>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Friday, May 3, 1907.</h3>—Big sea to-day. Tochigi
again seasick. I'm not feeling so well; neither is Mrs.
London. At dinner no one could stay at the table,
the boat rocked so. Jack and Mrs. London were
thrown clear across the cabin. All my dishes swimming
around the floor—nothing will stay on the stove.
I just slid across cabin and ran into Mrs. London coming
head-first down companionway. Not badly hurt.
We are averaging 5½ knots.</div>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Saturday, May 4, 1907.</h3>—Last night we had some
hard luck; at five o'clock the gooseneck, the piece of
iron that holds the main gaff to the barrel on the
main boom, broke, and let down the gaff. We took
the gooseneck off the gaff of the storm trysail and replaced
the one that had broken; and went below to
supper. Just as we sat down the blamed thing came
crashing down again, so we had to lash it with ropes,
and let it go until we reach Honolulu—if we ever
get there. But these goosenecks breaking looks bad.
Both were of wrought iron; on the second one we
would have depended in time of storm. Jack says
it is just like macaroni, the way it snapped. Wind
pretty stiff, and a suggestion of rain in the air. Feeling
rather sick.</div>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Sunday, May 5, 1907.</h3>—Fine day, and everybody <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>p065</span>
feeling well. I've just now begun to enjoy this trip.
Wonder what's going on in the world, anyway! I've
come to the point where I've forgotten what the world
was like. The past is all like some dream. Our
world is a big, blue expanse of water, reaching in an
eternal circle to the horizon; a blue, clear-looking sky
overhead, in which journeys the hot, glowing sun;
and a tiny boat, a speck in the immensity of things,
pursuing its solitary way across the deep. Loafed
on deck most of to-day. We are far south of the
regular track of steamers. Bert and Tochigi and I
are all writing on our diaries this evening. The Londons
have retired. Captain Eames is at the wheel,
singing some sea-song—seems to be happy. Course
south by west.</div>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Monday, May 6, 1907.</h3>—Baked bread and made
biscuits to-day; had fine success. Fourteen days out of
Frisco. Bert and Captain Eames took a bath in the
ocean to-day—got clear down on the stays, and let
the motion of the boat do the rest. Bert keeps declaring
that he will let go and have a decent swim,
but Jack warns him that if he does the sharks will
get him. But Bert says the sharks are all with the
dolphins and porpoises and bonita—in other words,
that there aren't any. Changed our course to southwest
by west. I think we are a little over half-way.
To-night, we are going to start a game of whist and
play it up until the moment we land. Everybody is
making fun of my whiskers. Of course, I haven't <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>p066</span>
shaved since we left, and I have an awful growth of
beard, which I shan't scrape off until we reach port.
Bert is the same way; there are times when he looks
like a pirate. A queer bird hove in sight to-day. It's
circling around us. It's white, with a long tail, sharp
as a needle, and a long bill. Jack says he never
heard of any like it before. I have my washing out.
We just tie ropes on our clothes and tow them overboard
all night, and in the morning they are clean;
all we have to do is hang them up to dry. We crossed
the line last night and are now in the tropics, or torrid
zone. Have not seen a ship for over a week. Well,
Jack's idea was to get away from the crowd, and certainly
he has nothing to complain of in that respect.
No mail, no telephones, no telegraph messengers, no
cranks, nothing at all to bother him. He writes every
day, and then does his trick at the wheel, or helps with
the sailorising. Tochigi is at the wheel, reading a
Japanese novel up-side down and from the back—or
so it looks. Last night at supper he took the wheel,
and played some weird music on his bamboo flute.
We all stopped eating to listen. It is hard to realise
that it is over a thousand miles to land in any direction.</div>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Tuesday, May 7, 1907.</h3>—Played whist last night,
and had a fine time. Jack and Mrs. London won both
games. Captain Eames looked on until a lamp fell on
his head, and after that he seemed to lose interest.
Tochigi had the wheel. When I am feeling sick, my
early-morning watch seems terribly long; but if I am <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>p067</span>
well, it is really enjoyable. We are taking a good
many pictures now-a-days. I develop and print my
own pictures, and all the others'. Jack requires a good
many as illustrations to his magazine articles. To-day,
Bert and Captain Eames set the spinnaker sail. Bert
went out on the boom and got a good ducking, but
the water is fine and warm, so it wasn't disagreeable.
As I write, I have to hold on to the companionway
with one hand. Lat. 22°—44′—24″, Long. 136°—4′.
We figure that another ten days will put us in
Honolulu. Captain has just hung the map with our
course, and it's the most zigzagged route I ever saw.
Yesterday we actually went out of our way fourteen
miles. Everyone is feeling good, even if we are rolling
some. I realise now, that, joking aside, this is as
perilous a voyage as ever human beings voluntarily
ventured on. We could never weather a hard storm.
For the boat won't heave-to. And no one aboard
knows how to make her heave-to. A fine warm evening,
and the most beautiful sunset. It's queer we see
no fish, for by all the books we have on fish, this
is where they should be found. Jack throws out his
trolling line every day, but catches nothing. Our
course to-night is west-southwest.</div>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Wednesday, May 8, 1907.</h3>—My pay-day—but
what's the use? I can't spend any money here. It
may be two weeks before we reach Honolulu. Had
fair wind to-day—changed course to south by west. <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>p068</span>
At meals, Mr. and Mrs. London and Mr. Eames eat,
Tochigi waits table, and Bert takes wheel; then we
three eat. We are having lots of Portuguese men-of-war
these days; they are a kind of jelly-fish that move
in schools and have a sail in the middle of their backs.
Jack and Mrs. London are playing pedro, and Bert is
putting out the sidelights. It is getting awfully monotonous,
always swaying up and down on these big waves—now
away in the valley formed by two big swells,
then on top of one of them. We are all over our
seasickness, and feeling pretty good. Bert is certainly
just right for this trip. He is robust and strong—a
young Hercules. We are all discarding our shirts
and wearing white trousers and canvas shoes. Fortunately,
the breeze keeps the air from getting oppressively
warm. Bert takes his daily bath from the stays.</div>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Thursday, May 9, 1907.</h3>—Jack and Mrs. London
swear they saw three flying fish to-day; we think they
are mistaken. Jack has had a spoon-hook out ever
since we left, but has not even had a nibble. Tochigi
washed out some clothing to-day—I made a picture
of him at it. Lat. 21°—42′—14″, Long. 139°—22′—15″.
If only I could get some sleep! But the sea is
so rough that I just roll from one side of the bunk to
the other. We have all kinds of music. Jack has
a big talking-machine, with over five hundred records;
some of them are of the finest opera music, vocal and
instrumental. How strange it would be, if one could
stand off a hundred yards and watch the little <i>Snark</i>
 <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>p069</span>
go by on the crested waves, while the voice of Caruso,
say, sang from our companionway. I think one would
rub his eyes, and think it something visionary, unreal.
We have awnings on deck which help to keep off the
heat of the sun. And oh, yes, besides the talking-machine
and the musical records, we have an Edison
language-machine, with Italian, German, Spanish, and
French records, and a text-book for each language.</div>

<h3>Friday, May 10, 1907.</h3>—Sea rough to-day. Everybody
needing sleep. Saw some flying fish, but
couldn't catch any. Been threatening rain; wind from
northeast, course southwest. It's mighty hard to cook,
for nothing will stay on the stove. What does slops
out. I am thrown around all the time. Water still
sopping around in galley. It is a good thing we are
prepared for the wet—we have rubber hip-boots, oilskin
coats, rubber sou'-westers. Then, for work, there
are blue flannel shirts, blue calico shirts; and for dress,
silk shirts. We have also brought pajamas, for use
in very warm weather. How the boat rocks and
pitches! What wouldn't I give to stand still for only
a minute? Tochigi is relapsing into seasickness again.</div>

<p class="center">

 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;·</p>

<p>The next day found us in a fierce sea. We were all
soaked with water. Indeed, it was impossible to step
on deck without getting wet. Great waves, many times
higher than the <i>Snark</i>, kept sweeping down as if to
swamp us, but always we slid along the top of them,
seeing for miles around; then would come the dive
 <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>p070</span>
down into the slough, where everything was blotted
from view but a wild swirl of waters. It was next to
impossible to cook. Dishes defied all laws of gravitation,
and skimmed like birds through the air; and the
stove was a sight, what of the things that slopped over
it. We were covered with bruises from being thrown
up against the vessel. Mrs. London made another
aerial descent of the companionway that night, but was
only slightly bruised. Captain Eames scraped the skin
off his head in the course of one tumble. I got my
punishment in burns from the stove. Far above, in
the tropic sky, the lightning flashed and the thunder
rolled. Lightning had an awful significance to the
crew of the <i>Snark</i>. We were far out at sea; the copper
and other metals would tend to draw the current,
and had a spark ever reached us, and ignited the eleven
hundred gallons of gasolene on board, there wouldn't
have been a splinter left to tell the tale.</p>

<p>Like all sailors, we did not love the sea. It was
the eternal menace. Looking upon its placid surface
in moments of calm, we could almost forget that it
was forever yawning, and that into its maw had gone
many a brave ship, of greater tonnage than ours.
But in raging storms, with the lightning shooting in
fiery lines across the sky, and the artillery of heaven
rumbling and banging overhead and echoing on the
storm-lashed waves, we came to appreciate the true
meaning of things, and to assign to earth and sky and
sea the proper values. At such moments, I repeat, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>p071</span>
we did not love the sea; but we did love the <i>Snark</i>.
Its ten tons of wood and metal stood between us and
destruction. It made life possible to us. It was in
such reflections as these, miles and miles from any land,
that the words of Jack London rang again in my ears:
"Life that lives is life successful. The achievement
of a difficult feat is successful adjustment to a sternly
exacting environment." Well, we strove to accomplish,
and our environment was savage. Supreme courage
and unwavering vigilance alone could enable us
to adjust ourselves, and come alive out of the welter
of foam and frothing waves that assailed the little
<i>Snark</i> the greater part of her perilous voyage to
Hawaii.</p>

<p>Even out in the ocean, several kinds of birds follow
in the wake of ships to pick up the leavings. With a
piece of meat tied on a string, we succeeded in catching
a guny. These gunys are a species of albatross,
and they live, sleep, and find their food entirely on
the face of the great deep. When these birds are
swimming on the surface of the water and wish to rise
into the air, they cannot make the ascent as most birds
do, simply by flapping their wings. They must start
swimming rapidly, with wings extended, until their
speed becomes sufficient to enable them gradually to
rise into the air. Before they start to fly, they are
literally walking on the water. The meat of the guny
is not palatable, and looks something like the meat of
an ordinary crow. <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_72"
 id="Page_72"></a>p072</span></p>

<p>Every day, Jack wrote two hours. Just two hours,
no more, no less. He would get up in the morning and
take his trick at the wheel, have breakfast, and then
shut himself in his stateroom for just two hours and
write. He always laughed at what he called the tomfoolery
of waiting for inspiration to come. He doesn't
believe there is any such thing as inspiration—he himself
can write just as well at one time as at another.
It is plain work, he says, and the only way he can do
it is to go ahead and do it. Incidentally, I may mention
that Jack London never rewrites a story. He
writes it just once, and never goes over it to change
it. He writes with a fountain pen, and nobody can
read his writing but Mrs. London. He turns his
manuscript over to her, and she types it and gets it
ready for the publishers.</p>

<p>In addition to their writing and typing, both the
Londons did their trick at the wheel, and even helped
Bert at the sailorising. When the weather was calm
and we had gotten over our sickness, we would all
gather on deck and talk, and tell each other of our experiences
before chance grouped us together on the
<i>Snark</i>. Of course, Jack had lived more of life than
any of us. He spent hours recounting to us tales
of the Klondike, and other faraway places he had visited.
One of the most interesting things he told us
was of how he came to write. Since his days in the
grade schools of Oakland, he had nursed the secret wish
to become a writer. He spent long hours poring over
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>p073</span>
books of history, travel, and fiction. But everything
seemed against him. His father, a veteran of the
Civil War, was slowly dying, and it became necessary
for Jack to turn to and help support the family. He
worked at everything and anything. Now he was a
sailor, now a San Francisco Bay oyster-pirate, now a
member of the Bay Fish Patrol. He mowed lawns
and washed windows, and cleaned carpets, and worked
in canneries and other factories. Through all this experience,
his Socialistic tendencies were strengthened,
and he ardently espoused the cause of revolution, and
clings to it still. He wrote evenings after he came
home from work, but all his manuscripts were returned
to him. At last, however, came the day. He had
been to the Klondike, and had returned penniless and
stricken with scurvy. He could do little work. Between
odd jobs, he wrote. One night, coming home,
he conceived the idea of turning some of his Arctic experiences
into stories. That evening he sat down and
produced the great story that made him famous, and
that has been read round the world, "The White
Silence." It was written from things he knew. It
was a bit of life, "cut from the raw, and woven round
with words." A big western magazine promptly published
it, paying him the scanty sum of five dollars.
But his next story, published in an eastern short-story
magazine, brought him better monetary return, so that
he was enabled to go ahead and write. And we all
know that he succeeded. <span class="xpno"><a
 name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>p074</span></p>

<p>Another rather amusing thing Jack told us was of
an experience in Manchuria, during the Russo-Japanese
War. He had been sent as war correspondent by
a big American newspaper syndicate, and besides his
scratch-pad, he was provided with a camera. One day
he started to take some pictures, and was promptly
arrested and haled before the military authorities. A
fat and rather deaf old Jap officer began to question
him.</p>

<p>"Why do you take pictures?"</p>

<p>"Because I wish to."</p>

<p>"And why do you wish to?"</p>

<p>"Because I desire to."</p>

<p>And so it went for half an hour, question and
answer, attack and rebuff. Other correspondents who
had been rounded up with cameras in their possession
followed the same plan. At last, the Jap officer gave
up in disgust, and allowed them all to depart, though
warning them of what might happen to them in time
of war.</p>

<p>During this period, there was strict censorship of
all letters and telegrams, both coming and going. The
war correspondents were in a quandary. They desired
to keep their papers posted on the latest developments,
but were unable to get a line of information
beyond the frontier. They tried cipher-codes and
various freak methods of writing, but without avail.
These messages were destroyed as being of a suspicious
character. At last, however, one of the enterprising <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>p075</span>
correspondents hit upon a plan. He wrote plain English
to his paper. Just at the time, an important military
manœuvre was in progress. By building a bridge
over a certain river, the Japs would be enabled to
transport their supplies, and to gain control of an important
position. So the war correspondent wrote to
his paper a rather rambling personal letter, of no consequence
whatever, but at the end casually mentioned
that the Japanese troops were on the bank of the river,
with timber and big wooden beams and posts. "I'm
not allowed to tell you what they're doing, but you
can bet they're not digging a well." Fortunately, the
editor was a man of acumen; out of all the chaff he
sifted the grain of wheat, and his paper had an enviable
beat, that great delight of the editorial heart.</p>

<p>When we all got to navigating in good shape, we
found that we were able to produce a widely different
set of figures. Of course, each could prove the correctness
of his points. I well remember the day that
my figures showed we were in the Atlantic Ocean instead
of the Pacific. As I think back, I wonder more
and more that we ever got anywhere, what of our
brilliant navigation. But luck was with us. We did
eventually get to port, though not without stress and
storm.</p>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Monday, May 13, 1907.</h3>—We have had all kinds
of excitement to-day. This morning, about eleven, I
lay asleep in the bow, when Tochigi awoke me and
pointed just ahead on our port side, and there were <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>p076</span>
thirty or forty whales; not very big, but they certainly
looked big. I guess they would average twenty or
twenty-five feet, and had an enormous fin in the centre
of their backs. They were playing, now darting our
way, now the other way. They looked very lazy floating
on the waves. In half an hour they had disappeared.
Jack calls them fin-backs, and says they are
very rare. While they were here, the air and water
seemed alive with flying fish. These flying fish are of
the four-winged kind, about a foot long. Bert and I
have been sitting on the deck practising different kinds
of knots. It's getting awfully hot. We are all discarding
as much clothing as we can. Captain Eames
says we will sight Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa next
Friday morning, and make Pearl Harbor, on the
island of Oahu, Sunday. I hope so, but I'm sceptical.
Don't think anyone knows our bearings within a hundred
miles or so. Bert and I went in bathing to-day.
Got out on the bobstay, under the bowsprit, and every
time the boat would dip we would go under, and the
speed of the boat made it hard for us to hang on.
If ever we let go, it would be all up with us. It's
dangerous, anyway, for sharks are supposed to be thick
here. Getting hotter every day. Now registers 90°;
we are not making much speed at present. My bread
was a failure to-day, so I've got to do it again or we'll
starve. Great excitement just now: Mrs. London
has discovered the Southern Cross, a cluster of stars
that sailors use for reckoning after they get too far <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>p077</span>
south to use the North Star. It's directly south, and
never changes position. Bert and I shaved to-day,
and put on our lightest clothes.</div>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Wednesday, May 15, 1907.</h3>—We are making fine
time. Best yet—and all sails drawing. Weather
perfect. At noon, registered 88°, but since then about
80°. We have things closely packed aboard the
<i>Snark</i>. Not an inch of wall-or ceiling-space but is
utilised. Even the "leaves" of the dining-table close
down over a chest-of-drawers that contains all the table-linen.
In the two little staterooms forward, devoted
to Jack and Mrs. London, there are all sorts of cubbyholes.
Closets, large and small, honeycomb the sides
and ceilings. Mrs. London can hang her dresses full
length, and she has even a hat-box. Then, too, Jack
has his tobacco-stores—plenty of tobacco. This evening,
the new moon and the stars are brighter than I
ever saw them, and there are many new stars, unfamiliar
to me. We expect to sight Hawaii to-morrow,
that is, if, as Bert says, "we are where we are." Bert
has been telling me about his father, who was shot by
a desperate leper in these islands. He was sheriff,
and was trying to take the leper to Molokai, the Leper
Island. I made some good pictures of Mrs. London
to-day—she dresses simply these days, bare-headed,
blue sailor waist, plain short skirt. Only a few more
dog-watches, and then I'll get a good long sleep. This
getting up at four in the morning, and steering till
six, is no joke. During that time I have to put out <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>p078</span>
the sidelights and binnacles, and stow the sidelights
in the bos'ns locker, then call Jack. We turn the clock
back about ten minutes each day.</div>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Thursday, May 16, 1907.</h3>—This morning at four
it was raining when I went on watch, so I put on my
oilskins. The wind died out in a little while, and I
don't think we have moved over ten knots all day.
The surface of the ocean is as calm as San Francisco
Bay. Very warm. It is fine these nights, to lie in
one's bunk without any bedclothes, and with no flies
or mosquitoes to bother. Jack and Bert and I went in
bathing on the bowsprit in the afternoon, and Bert let
go and swam with the ship. If a shark had put in
an appearance, or if a puff of wind had sent the boat
ahead, it would have been all up with him. We
dressed, and then took pictures of each other. Captain
Eames and Mrs. London were at the cockpit, and
Tochigi was below making candy. Suddenly Bert
yelled, "Look at that fin," and we were all excitement
at once. We ran to the stern, and there was a real,
live shark, about seven feet long. Jack threw over a
shark-hook, attached to a ninethread. The hook was
a big thing, weighing over a pound, and a foot long;
and the ninethread is a little thicker than one's finger.
We baited the hook with a piece of fat pork, and the
shark made a dive for it, but did not swallow it.
However, we coaxed him up within a few feet of the
boat, where we could get a good look at him. He was
about the shape and colour of an enormous cat-fish, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>p079</span>
except that he was of slimmer build and his fin and
gills were larger. The ugliest head, with little, mean-looking
eyes! Just ahead of his fin was the pilot fish,
occasionally darting ahead to inspect the boat, or so
it seemed. The pilot was a pretty fish, ten inches long,
and striped like a zebra. They stayed with us all of
two hours. Now and again, the shark would turn over,
belly upward, and make a rush for the hook, but never
did he get it. The water was so clear that we could see
him easily. I brought up a cold lunch, and we never
took our eyes off the fish. Tochigi could hardly break
away long enough to take the dishes below. About
six o'clock we saw the pilot fish take its position back
of the shark's head. They swam up close to the side
of the boat, then glided off to the north and disappeared.
We are moving scarcely at all now. No
motion to the boat. With about twenty hours of fair
wind, we could sight the islands.</div>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Friday, May 17, 1907.</h3>—Great excitement again.
We think we've sighted land. If our conjectures are
correct, the island of Hawaii is to our port bow, and
Maui dead ahead. They were discovered by Mr. and
Mrs. London, while they were playing cribbage in the
cockpit and watching one of these perfect tropical sunsets.
Both spots of land loom up like high mountains,
and look about fifty or sixty miles distant. Jack
has given orders that all on watch to-night go forward
every five minutes and take a lookout. It got dark
so early, or rather we sighted the supposed land so <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>p080</span>
late, that we got only about a half-hour's light to watch
them; but on my watch in the morning I ought to get
a good look at them, or at least at Maui, for we
have changed our course to west-northwest, and will
draw off from Hawaii by morning if the wind does
not die down. It is now only about two knots strong.
Previous to our discovery, we had been in low spirits,
for Bert discovered that out of three observations,
none agreed, and all varied about sixty miles. We
suspected that our chronometer had gone wrong; and
we feared that we might flounder around for weeks
and never find the islands. Jack had given orders to
be saving on food and water, and to wash in salt water,
but he has countermanded that order now. Jack is
poring over his maps, on the cabin table.</div>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Saturday, May 18, 1907.</h3>—Marvel of marvels!
We have really found the islands. They are in exactly
the place the reckonings put us, but it seems
strange to be coming in from the south. This morning
on my watch the clouds were so dense on the horizon
that I could not make out land. Jack came on deck
at five o'clock, and we searched the horizon for an hour,
and finally gave up and decided that it was clouds we
saw last night. But just then Mrs. London came on
deck and cried, "Oh!" and then, "Isn't that lovely!"
and sure enough, the clouds had parted, and disclosed
the snow-peaked active volcano of Mauna Loa on the
island of Hawaii, only about twenty miles to port. It
was a fine sight—Mauna Loa, over thirteen thousand <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>p081</span>
feet high, the largest active volcano in the world!
Well, we kept off her until noon, when we sighted
Maui, reaching over ten thousand feet into the air.
This evening Molokai is off our port bow, Molokai, the
island where hundreds of poor wretches afflicted with
leprosy are isolated. We are headed direct for her,
and will round her in the morning and sight Oahu.
Expect to be in Pearl Harbor to-morrow night. We
have a fine breeze; making almost six knots. To-night
the watches will be doubled—one person forward and
one at the wheel: Mrs. London and Tochigi from
eight till twelve, Mr. Eames and Bert until four, and
Jack and I until eight. To-day, Tochigi found a flying
fish on deck, that had flown aboard and fallen helpless.</div>

<h3>Sunday, May 19, 1907.</h3>—This morning Jack took
the lookout, and I took the wheel. Until daylight we
could not make out our position. Molokai gradually
came in view to our port, and as the light grew stronger
we could make out the rocks that the steamer <i>Manchuria</i>
ran into on Oahu. About that time, the wind
played out, and all day we have remained in almost
the same spot. It's awfully exasperating to be within
sight of Honolulu, or nearly so, and not be able to get
there. It is a fine day. This evening the wind freshened
a bit, so that we got about twenty-five miles closer—that
is, within twenty-five miles of Honolulu—but
the wind didn't last long. I can hear the sails jibbing
back and forth, and the booms are cracking around
in a way I don't like. A calm is often far more dangerous <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>p082</span>
to the rigging of a small vessel than is a storm.
Worst of all, the currents are carrying us toward
Molokai; and if we are wrecked on its rocky coast,
we will never be allowed to leave. But we will surely
make Pearl Harbor in the morning. This afternoon
we baited a hook with pork and caught a guny. He
was a large one—measured over six feet from tip of
one wing to tip of other wing. They are said to get
seasick when caught, but this one didn't. When we
let him overboard, he gave one disgusted look at us,
and swam away. He tried to fly, but think his
wings were too full of water from struggling to get
free. The ocean is now alive with life. Flying fish
are everywhere. There are fish of every sort, and
schools of porpoises. Late this evening, we sighted a
steamer, and a couple of sloops are away off on our
port horizon.</div>

<p>The next morning, twenty-seven days out of Frisco,
we were near to Honolulu. We were met by the customs
tug, from the deck of which papers were thrown
to us. One of the papers had pictures of the <i>Snark</i>,
and a long story, telling that, considering the twenty-seven
days out of San Francisco, all hope had been given
up of the <i>Snark's</i> ever reaching port—that she had
evidently gone down with all hands. When the customs
tug volunteered to tow us into Pearl Harbor,
eighteen miles from Honolulu, Jack jumped at the
chance. The <i>Kamehameha</i> and the <i>Kalaohkun</i>, of <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>p083</span>
the Hawaiian Yacht Club, came out to meet us, and
escorted us into Pearl Harbor. We passed several
Japanese <i>sampans</i>, the first I had ever seen, queer
little flat boats used by the Jap fishermen. Once a
monstrous turtle, said to be the largest ever seen in these
parts, swam near us, and lifted his ungainly head to
gaze at us. We took his presence as an omen of
good luck.</p>

<p>Pearl Harbor has a small mouth like a river, which
is called Pearl Locks. Inside, the harbour is deep and
large. It was then being fitted up as a base of supplies
and repairs for the American navy, by Captain
Curtis Otwell, who was in charge of the entire construction
work. A little later, we dropped anchor in
Pearl Harbor, and furled the sails. I cannot begin
to tell how good it was to be on solid ground again,
after twenty-seven days of pitching and rolling on the
sea. It seemed too good to be true. We called the
harbour "Dream Harbour." It seemed to suit better
than any other name—for was this not all a dream?
We were met by a throng of reporters, camera fiends,
Kanakas, and a general mixture of nationalities, and
one and all gave us a hearty welcome to their island.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>p084</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />
A PACIFIC PARADISE</h2>
<p class="toclink"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></p>
<p>Land at last! It seemed like Paradise. When we
saw the rich, soft grass, we felt like getting down and
rolling on it, it looked so good. Commodore Hoborn,
of the Hawaiian Yacht Club, had tendered the
use of his bungalow to Jack and Mrs. London, an
offer that was gratefully accepted. The bungalow was
only a few yards from our anchorage, so that the
<i>Snark</i> family remained within easy hailing distance.
We unlashed our boats, covered the sails, and threw
out the spinnaker-boom; and then the Londons went
ashore with the commodore, while we remained for
the time on the <i>Snark</i>, besieged by reporters and photographers.</p>

<p>When the customs inspector's tug offered to tow us
into Pearl Harbor, Jack had been quick to accept the
kindness; but I had kept looking toward Honolulu,
where I knew there was fresh meat and fruit, to say
nothing of the varied life of the city. But I soon
thought differently. Along the coast for several hundred
feet out the water was white with breakers.
After we got nearer to the mouth of Pearl Harbor,
we could see palms along the shore, and other tropical
trees, while in the water plied busy Chinese junk-fishers <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>p085</span>
and Japanese <i>sampans</i> and native sloops, the occupants
in a state closely approaching nudity. The air
was warm and balmy. We all gaped with wonder—all
except Jack, who had been here before.</p>

<p>It was two o'clock that afternoon when we got shoreleave.
We could hardly walk. The land tilted and
heaved, even as the <i>Snark</i> had tilted and heaved. I
caught myself spreading my feet apart to prevent my
falling, just as we did on the boat. A train ran every
hour to Pearl City, so we made haste to catch it. It
was one of the queerest trains imaginable, a little yellow
car and a miniature engine, loaded down with
Chinamen and Japs dressed in their native costumes,
and the reporters who were returning to Pearl City
after interviewing the crew of the <i>Snark</i>. Pearl City,
which was only a mile away, consisted of a depot and a
few Japanese and Chinese stores. We ate our lunch
in a roadside hotel, where girls played guitars and
danced and sang all through the meal.</p>

<p>All the next day we packed things back and
forth from the boat to the bungalow, and put up
hammocks and mosquito netting. It was a one-storey
building, with low, protruding roof. There were
four rooms, but even this seemed commodious after
nearly a month on the <i>Snark</i>, where space in every
direction was rigidly economised. One continuous
window let in the sunshine on all four sides of
the bungalow; and the yard was filled with little
forests of cocoanut palms, and a profusion of bananas, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>p086</span>
figs, papaias, guava palms, and other tropical trees.
The grass was large and blue, and, fortunately, sheltered
no chigoes—or, as they are often called, chiggers—to
drive us mad with their biting. Along the
shore was the sea-wall and a long boat-landing; here
the water was so clear that one could see to the bottom
in ten feet of it, to where the coral lies in wonderful
patterns, and shells nestle down almost out of sight,
and fish of every colour swim back and forth.</p>

<p>The weather was perfect. It is always perfect.
The temperature never varies over ten degrees—from
about 75° to 85°. There was always plenty of food,
growing right to one's hand; no tropical diseases to be
seen, at least not yet; no dirt, no smoke; everything
so pleasing and satisfying as to be beyond description.
The only thing that really kept us on the jump was
the mosquitoes. Sitting in our main room, in pajamas,
reading, talking or writing, we were obliged to burn
mosquito powder all the time, and even that did little
to rid us of the pests. Mark Twain had a bungalow
near here a few years ago, and the story is told that
he had netting put all around his bed, alow and aloft,
that he might sleep without losing any of his blood;
but the mosquitoes got in anyway, and nearly tormented
the life out of him. At last, however, he made
the discovery that when the mosquitoes once got inside
the netting, they could not find their way out, so
he used to lie there as a bait until all were safely ensnared,
then crawl out and sleep upon the floor. <span
 class="xpno"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>p087</span></p>

<p>In the next few days, we were continually finding
new things to do and to see. We swam in the crystal-clear
water, despite the natives' warnings about sharks.
For my part I had plenty of leisure. After an heroic
silence of days, the crew finally broke out in protest
against my cooking; they simply could stand no more
of it. When on the sea, it had been eat it or starve;
but now that they were ashore, there was greater latitude
of choice. After that, we all boarded with different
white families in the vicinity, and the poor harassed
crew forgot its troubles in the delight of eating once
more the things that humans eat, cooked as humans
would cook them.</p>

<p>The people of Oahu were very accommodating, always
bringing us fruit and looking after our wishes
with a care unknown in the States. The conductor
on the mile-long railroad-run to Pearl City brought us
various fruits gathered along the way; and when we
were riding and saw anything we wanted, he would
stop the train to get it. Coming from Honolulu one
night, the main train switched, and took me direct to
our bungalow, carrying along four other coaches of
Japs and Chinese. The conductor was an American.
He said that he didn't care whether "the cattle"—referring
to my fellow-passengers—got anywhere or
not.</p>

<p>Much of our time, however, was spent on the <i>Snark</i>,
where we were constantly receiving visitors. I met
a great number of American and English people, and <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>p088</span>
many natives. As for the population of the islands,
the Japanese greatly predominate. I think, in figures,
it runs about as follows: sixty-one thousand Japanese,
forty-five thousand Chinese, twenty-three thousand
British, twenty-five thousand Americans, twelve thousand
five hundred natives (Kanakas), four hundred and
fifty South Sea Islanders, and six hundred and fifty
Portuguese; and as nearly all these people dress in
their native costumes, the whole has a decidedly cosmopolitan
look. As for Honolulu, it consists mostly of
stores run by Japs and Chinese—many call it Little
Japan. There are many half-castes and quarter-castes
on the islands. I knew one man who could trace
through his ancestry connection with every one of the
principal divisions of the human family.</p>

<p>On June 3 occurred the first split in the <i>Snark</i> crew.
Captain Eames decided that he had had enough yachting,
and departed on the steamship <i>Sierra</i> for California.
Shortly after, word came from Bert's mother,
asking him to return and continue his course at Stanford
University. Bert considered a while over this,
but in the end decided to do as she had asked. He
formally resigned from the crew, and went to Honolulu
to stay until he could work his way back to California.
It seemed as if the newspapers could never
get through inventing falsehoods about Jack and the
rest of us. When Bert left, they reported that Jack
was a big, bullyragging brute, and had beaten all of <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>p089</span>
us into a pulp. As a matter of fact, there was never
so much as a quarrel among us.</p>

<p>Jack and Mrs. London had gone to Honolulu, and
were staying at the Seaside Hotel. Every day, Jack
would send me his exposed films and I would develop
them and send prints by the next train. Never
was there so obliging a person as Tony, conductor of
the mile-long railroad I have mentioned, and which,
because of its nature, we called the Unlimited. Tony
was not only conductor, but he was also engineer, fireman,
brakeman and porter. If he could help us at
the house, he would bank the fire in the engine, and
leave his train for half a day. Once, while watching
me at my photographing, he found that he was five
minutes late for the run to Pearl City, so he decided
not to make the trip. As he explained, nothing but
Japs and Kanakas (Hawaiians), and Chinamen rode
on it, and he didn't care anything about them. As
for us, when we rode he absolutely refused to collect
any fare. When I had made Jack's prints, I would
bundle them up and give them to Tony; then, when
he reached Pearl City, he would give them to the conductor
of the train for Honolulu, and eventually they
would find their way to Jack.</p>

<p>About this time, we got our new captain. He was
an old fellow who had been all through the South
Seas, and knew them like a book, and whom we will call
Captain X——. He was an ideal sea-captain of the <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>p090</span>
old school—the kind that is rough and headstrong.
He and I had a little set-to at first, but later ignored
each other as much as possible. About this time, too,
Gene Fenelon, a young fellow of thirty, came from
Oakland to take Bert's place as engineer. He and Jack
had known each other for some years, and were good
friends. We took a great liking to Gene, who was
really a clever fellow, though, as will be seen, he did
not last long at this particular job. He had been for
eight years assistant manager of an European circus,
and spoke several languages fluently. Bert and Gene
and I would go of nights up to the Hawaiian Yacht
Club, and coming back would frighten the very birds
off their perches by our vigorous sea-songs. During
the day we were busy around the boat, scraping the
masts and painting the galley, and developing and
printing Jack's negatives.</p>

<p>I myself spent a couple of days in Honolulu at this
period, doing some special camera work, and trying
my luck at surf-board riding. This is said to be one
of the greatest sports in the world, but as it takes
several months, at the least, really to learn it, I can
hardly testify as to that. But I do know that I was
nearly drowned, and managed to swallow a few quarts
of salt water before the fun wore off. Jack stayed
at it for some time, and got so sunburned that he was
confined to his bed. Let me say here that it is my
honest belief that only the native Hawaiians ever <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>p091</span>
really learn the trick in all its intricacies, despite the
fact that, at several contests held, white men have
come out victorious.</p>

<p>For my part, I found swimming and fishing at Pearl
Harbor much better sport. The fish bit readily. I
have caught as many as twenty in five minutes. In the
water, nearby, were turtles as big as a wash-tub. One
day a shark twenty-two feet long was killed, and the
day after one eighteen feet long.</p>

<p>Once, toward evening, Tochigi, Gene, and I were
out rowing in a little canvas boat. It sank about a
quarter of a mile from shore. Not that we cared
much, for we had on nothing but swimming trunks,
but we went lively when we discovered that a little
hammer-headed shark was close to us, circling around
in the water. He was too small to do us any harm,
but his little protruding eyes looked so fierce that we
all made haste for shore. This place was full of these
little hammer-headed sharks, as well as of turtles and
devil-fish.</p>

<p>It may sound rather strange when I say that we were
in the habit of wearing only swimming suits, but we
lessoned from the people we saw about us, and many
of them were more simply garbed even than that.
Mr. and Mrs. London, however, usually wore Japanese
kimonos. And our captain dressed like a tramp.</p>

<p>Captain X—— was a horrible example of what ill
temper will do. His half-breed son declared that he
was born angry. At any rate, he seemed aboard the <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>p092</span>
<i>Snark</i> to have the idea that he was working Kanaka
sailors, and would have sworn at us continually had we
allowed it. It may be that he had cause to be irritable,
for he had once been beaten out of a great fortune.
X—— had been plying around the South Seas for
twenty years, and once had discovered a small island
covered with guano—about twenty million dollars'
worth of it. X—— beat back to Honolulu with all
haste, that he might arrange to take the island in the
name of the United States. He was given the proper
authority, and with a small crew he hastened back to
his wonderful find. Daylight was breaking dimly as
he approached; there was sufficient light for him to see
a small Japanese man-of-war slipping in the gloom
toward the cherished island. When he and his men
landed, they were met by soldiers, who told them that
the island was now formally in the possession of the
Japanese government. I really think that this would
be enough to sour any man's temper. Another time,
he drifted around for weeks in a small ship, nearly
dead for water, and with half his crew lying corpses
on the deck. He escaped when wrecked off the coast
of the island of Maui. One of his occupations was
"shanghai"-ing South Sea Islanders for work on the
Hawaiian plantations; and a favourite trick was to
cheat the natives when buying copra—he would put
his knee under the sack while weighing it, thus making
a two-hundred-pound sack lose half of its weight.
He was a regular old skinflint; but whatever his merits <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>p093</span>
or demerits, one thing was certain: he had been everywhere
in the South Seas, and had the records to prove
it.</p>

<p>Much work was being done on the <i>Snark</i>. Men
came from Honolulu and put everything shipshape.
They got the seventy-horse-power engine to running,
also the dynamo of the small engine, painted the <i>Snark</i>
again, cleaned the rigging, scraped the masts and spars,
and stopped the leaks. Best of all, they put the engine
of the gasolene launch into condition. We used
to make little trips in the launch by night. All this
time, Jack and Mrs. London were making visits to the
neighbouring islands, so that we saw little of them.</p>

<p>Oftentimes, in the evening, I would spend an hour
or more watching the beauties of the Hawaiian scenery
when bathed in the soft beams of the moon. In the
harbour lay the <i>Snark</i>, looking as if lighted by electricity
where the moonbeams were mirrored on her
freshly painted sides and her polished metal, and
further away was the shadowy shore-line, fringed by
groves of cocoanut palms, and still further back, fading
away into the night, were the majestic mountains.</p>

<p>"The <i>Snark</i> will never be able to heave-to," we
were told. "She catches too much wind aft, no matter
how the sails are trimmed." But with the seventy-horse-power
engine in running order, the danger was
vastly minimised, for with its aid we could cut through
a storm like a knife.</p>

<p>The boat was taken to Honolulu for a thorough <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>p094</span>
overhauling. Of course, the crew went too. My stay
in Honolulu was one of the most enjoyable periods
of my life, despite the growing enmity between Captain
X—— and myself. None of us liked him; even
Jack was wishing for an opportunity to let him go.
He was an eccentric person, to say the least, and had all
the latest variations in his vocabulary. Being particularly
sore on me, he used to take his spite out by calling
inanimate objects about the vessel the names he really
intended to apply to the erstwhile cook of the <i>Snark</i>;
and when our repairs were complete and the <i>Snark</i> was
taken out for a trial trip, all the crew, except Captain
X——, knew that Jack was dissatisfied with Captain
X—— and would appoint a new captain at the first
opportunity—presumably Mr. Y——, who was then
on the boat as a common sailor. Hence his control of
us was rather broken; during the trip the entire crew
absolutely refused to be ordered about any; but, carried
out the work that was necessary to take the <i>Snark</i>
out in the bay and back again, while Captain X——
remained at the wheel, seemingly much disgruntled.
Entering the harbour, as a result of this misunderstanding
between the captain and crew, the <i>Snark</i> was
so manœuvred that she bumped into a trading-steamer,
and then into a bark, at both of which times the <i>Snark</i>
was slightly injured—several holes were made in the
stern. As soon as we touched the wharf, I telephoned
to Jack to come down, as the opportunity was at hand <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>p095</span>
for him to discharge the profane captain; and this
Jack did, with neatness and despatch, as soon as a cab
could bring him from the hotel.</p>

<p>During President Cleveland's administration, there
was considerable agitation about the annexation of
Hawaii to the United States. The natives had become
somewhat dissatisfied with Queen Lilioukalani, because
she refused to allow them to frame a constitution.
They felt that she wished to be the entire government.
The natives dethroned the queen, and elected Mr.
Frederick Doyle as their president, and they framed a
constitution as similar to that of the United States as
they could possibly get it. At this time a Mr. Thurston,
a prominent land-owner and one of the most influential
men on the island, took a hand in the administration
of public affairs. It was his advice that led to
President Doyle's trip to the United States, which resulted
in the annexation of the islands to our country;
and the Queen's palace became the United States Government
building. Mr. Thurston's plan of annexation
was a good one; it prevented the islands from falling
into the hands of the Japanese, who were rapidly gaining
control of them. Hawaii was civilised before the
western line of the United States; the grass huts had
disappeared before California was developed. This
progress in the Hawaiian Islands was due to the conscientious
efforts of the early missionaries; but there is
now to be found upon this island a class of people <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>p096</span>
who are the descendants of a few of the earlier missionaries
(who were of a distinctly mercenary turn of
mind and secured for their private use some of the
most valuable lands of the valley). The descendants,
known as the "missionary class" now live in
ease and comfort without putting forth the slightest
effort to help develop the islands or assist in the betterment
of anyone but themselves. Of course, they are
not missionaries, nor have they ever been missionaries
in the true sense, as they are not supported by any
church organisation, but live off the natural richness of
the land appropriated by their missionary forefathers.</p>

<p>During the development of the islands, it was
necessary, in order to secure suitable grounds for the
rapidly growing and beautiful city of Honolulu, to fill
in and raise above its former marshy level the entire
end of the Nuuanu Valley; and this large drainage
canal still disposes of the water from the upper valley.
The city of Honolulu now boasts of as fine hotels as
will be found anywhere in the world in a town of that
size, and the business section of the city is built upon
as solid a basis as any town of possibly twice the size.
In 1778, Captain Cook estimated the native population
of Hawaii as four hundred thousand. The 1900
census showed only about twenty-nine thousand natives
on the island. In their place have sprung up thousands
and thousands of Japs, Chinese, and half-castes.</p>

<p>With all its development and advancement, there <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>p097</span>
are still interesting spots in the city of Honolulu. One
will occasionally see a Japanese 'rickashaw, or see a
Japanese mother carrying her naked baby in the
streets. The Chinese section presents about the same
weird style of Chinese architecture as will be found in
many of the large cities in the States, where the Chinese
population still holds to its original manners and customs.
After the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands
to the United States, which took place in 1900, the
business advancement of the islands was very rapid,
in spite of certain peculiar laws enacted by the members
of the first legislative body. This body was composed
of natives who had no other idea in mind than to get
their names on a statute-book as the makers of law.
One of them even proposed an act to regulate the rise
and fall of the tides. Of course, he had an idea that
this legislative body, backed by all the authority of
the United States government, could accomplish any
act it saw fit to. Another member proposed a bill
creating the office of State Entomologist, as he had
read somewhere that an entomologist was a bug-man;
he had himself appointed to the office, and a few days
later came with another bill asking that the position
of State Entomologist be declared vacant, because
there were still bugs in his coffee. But these minor
defects in the first legislative body were rapidly overcome,
and now the people of Hawaii hold dear to their
hearts two flags, one the stars and stripes of the United <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>p098</span>
States, and the other the red, white and purple of
Hawaii. In their decorating, the two flags are always
in evidence, equal prominence given to each.</p>

<p>We paid a visit to the crater of an extinct volcano,
called The Punch Bowl. Out at Waikiki Beach the
surf-board riding could always be undertaken by such
as liked it; and there were other amusements. Once,
at Thomas Square, I heard the Royal Hawaiian Band
play, while a Sunday School gathering of Japanese
children sang. After they had finished, a Kanaka class
sang. All those three hundred children were dressed
in their native costumes. It was very enjoyable, even
if we couldn't understand a word of the songs.</p>

<p>We were in Honolulu over the Fourth of July, that
is, all but Jack and Mrs. London. Several American
transports, with fourteen thousand troops, lay in the
harbour. The celebration of the Fourth of July was
a moral event in Hawaiian history; and the parade
was one of the most splendid I have ever witnessed.
As a fitting climax to the day's festivities, a picked
baseball team from among the American soldiers challenged,
and were defeated by, a picked-up aggregation
of Japanese boys.</p>

<p>The development of the city of Honolulu under the
American flag is just as perfect and complete as in any
city in America. In fact, the street-car system of the
city of Honolulu is the most perfect in the world—all
fine, big sixty-foot observation cars, especially fitted for
the passengers to enjoy to the utmost the tropical <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>p099</span>
scenery along the delightful suburban routes. The fire
departments are fully equipped with the most efficient
and modern machinery, and their runs are just as awe-inspiring
as those of the city departments of our land.</p>

<p>The equable climate of Honolulu has tempted many
of the wealthiest people of the United States to select
it as a spot for permanent residence. As I think I
have mentioned before, the temperature varies only
about ten degrees, so that Hawaii is a veritable Paradise
of the Pacific. Beautiful homes are springing up
along the shady streets, some of the more elegant ones
costing many thousands of dollars. The Japanese
seem fully to understand the use of the picturesque
and beautiful trees found on the islands. The parks
are as pretty as any in the world, little pagodas and
brilliant-coloured trees and grasses usually so disposed
in landscape gardening as to carry out quaint Japanese
patterns. Some of the mammoth trees burst into a
mass of bright flowers, and they, too, will be found to
be set in varied designs. Here will be found the
famous banyan tree. One peculiarity of this tree is its
method of throwing down from the horizontal branches
supports, which take root as soon as they touch ground
and enlarge into trunks and extend branches of their
own, until one tree will cover an acre or more of
ground. A single tree has been known to cover seven
acres. The pleasant drives naturally stimulate the
breeding of fine horses. One may see here equipages
as superb as are to be found in Paris or London.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>p100</span></p>

<p>As a natural result of the religious basis upon which
the original civilisation of Hawaii was founded, there
are many fine churches, mostly constructed of lava.
Volcanic lava forms a very solid and permanent building
stone, being much heavier even than granite, and
susceptible of a very high polish.</p>

<p>Upon the island are several volcanoes. Scientists
have figured out that one of these is the progenitor of
the island of Oahu, and certainly, whatever the validity
of their claims, Oahu is entirely of volcanic origin.
Japanese now farm inside the crater of one extinct volcano,
which is more than a mile across. The volcanic
mountain called Diamond Head, the first point of land
observed by sailors approaching the Hawaiian Islands,
is as beautiful a bit of mountain scenery as will be found
on any sea-coast. On the island of Hawaii are the
two largest volcanoes in the world, Mauna Kea, thirteen
thousand eight hundred feet high, and Mauna
Loa, thirteen thousand six hundred feet high.</p>

<p>Thunderstorms are rare and hurricanes are unknown
in the Hawaiian Islands, hence the deep large bays
form very favourable shipping ports. Their position
puts them in direct line of vessels trading between
western North America on the one side, and eastern
Asia and Australia on the other. This is responsible
to a great extent for its commercial development.
Regular steamers come to Honolulu from San Francisco,
Vancouver, Yokohama, Hong-Kong and Sydney,
and the various ports of minor significance. Honolulu <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>p101</span>
is also a station of the Pacific Commercial Cable,
and has direct communication with the United States
and the Orient. During our stay, the cable ship <i>Relief</i>
came into the harbour. We saw ships of every
sort, from the little fishing craft, Jap <i>sampans</i>, up to
brigantines. One of the most interesting of all was
the transport, <i>Thomas</i>, with several thousand American
soldiers on board. Sailing-dates of one of the
large steamers are always big days; thousands of people
flock to the wharf.</p>

</div>

<p>Before leaving Honolulu, Captain X—— did everything
in his power to make me uncomfortable, for he
considered it my fault that he had lost his position. He
called me a mutineer and told Jack that I was not of
much account, anyway. As the time drew closer for
us to think of leaving Honolulu, we set several dates
for our departure, but always at the last minute something
went wrong with the engines, and we were compelled
to postpone sailing. Tochigi told me several
times that he thought he would quit—he could not
help but dread the seasickness he knew would afflict
him—but each time I persuaded him to remain, reminding
him that it would be a sorry trick to leave me
all alone to fight the sickness.</p>

<p>Whenever we set a date there would be a crowd of
people at the wharf to see us off, but each time we
were obliged to set out a sign, <i>Sailing postponed</i>, until
the people in Honolulu had ceased taking us seriously;
and one man asked Jack why he did not buy him a <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>p102</span>
house instead of living at a hotel—that it would be
cheaper. The Honolulu press came out with several
amusing articles on the <i>Snark</i>, and even reprinted the
old refrain of "Not yet, but soon." This, with other
articles, made us dislike to go upon the street, on account
of the comments, as we were pretty well known
by them. One day, while in King Street, one of the
principal thoroughfares of the city, I heard even the
newsboys crying: "When will the <i>Snark</i> sail?—Not
yet, but soon."</p>

<p>But after spending several months in Honolulu and
the suburb of Waikiki, we managed to leave the harbour
on a day when few people expected us to be ready.
The engines ran splendidly, until we were out of sight
of Honolulu; then the suction pump on the big engine
carried away.</p>

<p>Jack was angry, but said he would not go back to
Honolulu if the boat were sinking, so we set sail and
during the next three or four days sailed down past
the islands of Molokai and Maui. At the island
of Maui, the natives were catching mammoth turtles
that are sold in the Honolulu fish-markets; as a
matter of fact, these natives are regular fiends for
turtle-flesh. They catch their prey in a peculiar manner,
creeping upon them as they lie on the sandy beach
warming themselves in the sun. Two or three Kanakas
will steal down upon a turtle and flop him over
on his back, in which position he is powerless.</p>

<p>After nearly a week of sailing, we came in sight of <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>p103</span>
one of the largest active volcanoes in the world, Mauna
Loa, or, as the crater is called, Haleakala. This was
Captain Y—— 's first landfall, and I must say the
way he brought the <i>Snark</i> head-up into the wind and
lowered anchor was a marvel to us landlubbers, who
up to now had been sailing the vessel as a boy would
float a tub. Captain Y—— sailed and anchored the
<i>Snark</i> as a ship should be sailed and anchored. He
gave his orders in a tone that left nothing for us to do
but obey; not that his orders were delivered in the
manner of Captain X——, but instead in the strong,
clear tones of a man who was used to giving orders and
having them obeyed.</p>

<p>Kailua is the fifth largest town on the island of
Hawaii, and contains possibly one hundred persons.
The main business street of the town often appears
utterly deserted, as the natives say no one but fools
and Americans will venture out in the heat of the day.
The main business house is an American saloon run
by a Chinaman; the bar fixtures consisting of a counter
and a large refrigerator, which I am quite sure never
had any ice in it. Gene bought a glass of beer, but it
was so flat and warm that he could not drink it.</p>

<p>The volcano of Kilauea is situated on the leeward
side of the island of Hawaii, which makes it very
dangerous for sailing vessels. Captain Cook, whose
monument stands a few miles below this volcano, discovered
the Sandwich Islands, or Hawaii, while searching
for the Northwest Passage. He determined to <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>p104</span>
build here his winter home, and study conditions among
the islands while waiting for the snow and ice to
melt, that he might get through to Bering Strait. As
the natives had never seen the like of the saws and
axes and hammers used by the ship's carpenter in building
this house, they stole them. Not that the innocent
people knew what stealing was—they had merely
planted the tools in the ground in the hope that they
might grow and produce more tools. Captain Cook,
following his usual drastic methods, seized the old
King, whom he intended to hold as a hostage for the
return of his property. During the fight, several of
the natives were killed, and Captain Cook was himself
captured. When the sailors found that Captain Cook
had fallen into the hands of the natives, they sent word
that the King was to be held until Captain Cook was
returned. Captain Cook <em>was</em> returned; at least, as
much of him as could be found after the feast. The
body was brought aboard the ship in pieces, was buried,
and a monument erected. Beside the grave is the
grave of a Kanaka who used to boast proudly that he
had eaten the big toe of Captain Cook, for, as the
natives afterward explained, the captain had really
been eaten, and the body of a native substituted.</p>

<p>In the days gone by, the natives used to call the feast
of human flesh the long-pig feast. They still have
these feasts, only instead of human flesh they serve
the flesh of the wild boar, which is plentiful on the
island. Instead of roasting the pig from the outside, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>p105</span>
as we do, the natives dig a hole in the ground, and,
after making a fire, pile stones on top of the fire until
they are red hot, then put the stones on the inside
of the pig and bake him from the inside out, and serve
the meat with <i>poi</i>.</p>

<p>Like Oahu, the island of Hawaii is entirely of volcanic
origin. The two large volcanoes on this island,
Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, formerly had craters at
the tops, which have soiled over, and new craters have
opened up far down the mountainsides. In many
places the surface of the ground is nothing more than
lava, still in the exact condition the latest eruption has
allowed it to cool in, and seamed with fissures that
opened up as it cooled.</p>

<p>Kailua is one of the most lonesome, desolate spots
in the Hawaiian Islands. I had a great deal of time
in which I had nothing to do, for, as I have said, the
crew absolutely refused to eat my cooking any longer.
I used to sit on the lava coast and try to see across
the several thousand miles to America, where there
were people to whom I could speak; I did not understand
these people here. As Tochigi had finally
settled that he could not fight down his seasickness, he
had decided to remain in Kailua until the steamer could
take him back to Honolulu. I was very sorry to see
Tochigi go, but I appreciated his reason, and so offered
no more resistance. Gene I did not get very well
acquainted with; and Captain Y—— seemed too much
like a boss for me to be friendly with him, but afterward <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>p106</span>
he thawed out and we became the best of friends.
During the week that we lay in Kailua anchorage,
Tochigi and I made long trips into the interior and
along the coast, where we saw some of the large rice
and coffee plantations. The Chinese are the only
ones in the islands who have any success with rice;
we saw the young sprouts in the artificial marshes
they have made. The natives never make any attempt
at farming, except to farm fish. They have
large artificial fish-ponds that they stock with mullet
and crimps, and there is trouble if any person tries
to catch fish out of another man's pond. Fruit here,
as on all the islands, is very plentiful. There are
no seasons for it; it grows the year round.</p>

<p>The famous Kona coffee is raised on this side of the
island of Hawaii—in fact, this is the only place in
the islands where coffee can be raised, as elsewhere
the wind would disturb the coffee-tree and cause the
bean to shatter. The coffee is hulled by the old and
primitive method of allowing a large log to beat the
coffee until it is hulled.</p>

<p>A pleasant way of killing time was to do a little
amateur sailing with our life-boat. Gene and I knew
practically nothing about sailing such a small boat, and
when we got on the bay all the natives hunted shelter,
terrified by our manœuvres; and when we clumsily ran
on the beach, there was much amusement among the
natives who were loafing on shore. Mr. and Mrs.
London decided to go across the island to Hilo, on <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>p107</span>
the Puna coast, on horseback. So only Captain
Y——, Gene, and myself, and a white man we had
picked up in Honolulu, were left to take the <i>Snark</i>
around the island through the main strait to Hilo.</p>

<p>Little Tochigi, who had been but a bundle of Japanese
misery every minute at sea since leaving San
Francisco, now said good-bye to us. As we heaved
anchor and sailed out of the bay, the last thing we
saw of poor Tochigi was his diminishing form sitting
alone on the seashore, watching the <i>Snark</i> disappear
from his view.</p>

<p>The day before we left Kailua, a small trading sloop
came into the harbour and was still anchored when we
left; in fact, we later found that we had a whole day's
start on this boat; but during the time that the small
crew of the <i>Snark</i> was fighting head-winds and tide-rips
in the main channel, this vessel drew up and passed
us and was in Hilo Bay a day before us. After we
got to the Puna coast of Hawaii, we could see the
prettiest shore-line, rich with tropical fruit trees and
luxuriant vegetation. Scores of waterfalls, some of
them hundreds of feet above us, were scattered all
along this coast, clear into Hilo Harbor.</p>

<p>We dropped anchor in Hilo five days from Kailua.
The harbour here is too shallow for the largest steamships
to draw up close to the wharf, but the <i>Snark</i>, being
so small, was able to anchor just at the mouth of
the Waikaiea River. In the heart of Hilo's little
fishing suburbs, the town of Waikaiea is about one <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>p108</span>
mile along the seashore from Hilo proper, and is inhabited
almost wholly by Japs, Chinese and Kanakas.
Before going further, I had perhaps better explain
this word "Kanaka." In the Hawaiian language,
<i>Kanaka</i> means man, and <i>Wahine</i> means woman, but
all Hawaiians, both men and women, are called Kanakas
by the white people, so the word is generally understood
to mean native Hawaiian.</p>

<p>The people of Waikaiea are nearly all fishing people,
everyone taking a hand in the fishing. The men
go out in their boats just before sundown, and fish all
night long. At five o'clock in the morning the womenfolk
are waiting along the little river-docks to unload
the fish. The fish are carried into one of the fish-markets,
where the children sort out the different kinds
into piles. There are large tanks for the turtles and
octopuses; and big hooks are suspended from the
ceilings by pulleys for the larger fish that are too heavy
for handling. Then the auctioneer sells the fish to the
highest bidder. The big sharks weighing two and
three hundred pounds often bring less than a ten-pound
fish, as the fins are all that is used of certain
kinds of sharks. I have seen devil-fish, or octopuses,
that were thirty feet from the end of one tentacle to
the end of the opposite one. The fish are usually
bought by Japanese or Chinese fish-runners. Immediately
after they have secured all they can carry,
they start off at a dog-trot, which never ceases until <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>p109</span>
each has reached his district for selling, sometimes ten
or fifteen miles up the country.</p>

<p>To get to Hilo from the <i>Snark</i>, the best way was
to walk along the sandy beach clear into Hilo, for the
damp sand was always cool and refreshing, and the
sea breeze blowing made one want to take off his
shoes and roll up his trousers, and splash along in the
water, a thing I did many a time. Truth is, people,
after a few weeks in the Sandwich Islands, start doing
things they would never think of doing in the staid
old United States. The climate seems to make one
younger, for it is always spring in Hawaii.</p>

<p>On a quiet morning some strangely wonderful sights
may be seen. In the clear water one can easily make
out many-hued fish, and coral, sponges, coral-crabs;
and, under the sponges, small octupuses or devil-fish
from the size of one's hand down to the size of a silver
dollar.</p>

<p>Hilo has about five thousand, mixed population.
Here, as among all the islands of the group, the Japanese
predominate, with Chinese a close second. The
white people on this side of the island live mostly outside
of Hilo on plantations; and as the brown population
sleeps through the heat of the day, the business
streets are deserted until late in the afternoon. Then
the streets spring suddenly into life, and for several
hours are thronged with people of all nationalities.
The clubs and saloons are crowded, the band plays <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>p110</span>
nearly every evening, and everyone settles down to
enjoy himself.</p>

<p>Off the business streets, the residence district seems
like a park. The roads are well paved, electric lights
are strung at every crossing, hedges and fences are of
trees that usually bear flowers throughout the year.
Homes are mostly of the bungalow style, with large
porches running clear around the house. These
porches are used as dining and sleeping rooms the year
round. In fact, the people often give more thought
to the <i>lanai</i>, as they call the porch, than to any other
part of the house.</p>

<p>The lawns around the bungalows are studded with
fruit trees that are usually laden with ripe fruit at all
times. The small boys never care to steal fruit here,
as there is so much of it that anyone may help himself
to fruit wherever he finds it.</p>

<p>The fine public libraries, churches, and a good opera
house at Hilo are as truly modern buildings as any I
have seen in the United States. A large pineapple
factory is located here, and one steamer makes regular
trips from San Francisco to get the bananas that grow
wild along this coast.</p>

<p>Hilo supplies the United States with more cane-sugar
than any city in the world. Large sugar-mills
are located along the water-front, in order that ships
may load by gravity right from the mill. The sugar-cane
is raised back of Hilo, and as far back as twenty
miles into the mountains. The sugar-cane is sent to <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>p111</span>
the mill in long flumes that are filled with water, and
the cane laid in the flumes goes down to the mill at the
rate of twenty miles an hour.</p>

<p>The manager of the Waipalia sugar-mill invited
Jack, Mrs. London, Captain Y——, and me to go
for a flume-ride one Sunday, when there was no cane in
the flume. Cabs were secured, and we were driven
away back in the mountains to a good place to start
from. Before leaving Hilo we had donned our bathing
suits. Making a good seat of cane for ourselves, to
guard against possible nails, we all got in the flume
and started off. There is no more exciting sport in
the world than flume-riding. Often, we could look
down inclines, from one hundred and fifty to two
hundred feet below. We rushed so fast that had a
nail ever gotten in the way, it would certainly have
ripped off a lot of skin, but we could not stop, for to
have done so would have thrown us from the flume.</p>

<p>The rice fields looked like ordinary wheat fields.
The rice is threshed by the primitive method of cutting
the heads off the stalk, laying them on a large piece
of volcanic rock, and letting in Chinese with bare feet
to stamp upon it until the grain is hulled. Rice is an
important factor in the Hawaiian farming, as the Japs
and Chinese live upon it almost wholly. No rice is
exported; the orientals consume the entire output.</p>

<p>As the rice must be planted in the water, the rice
fields tend to breed mosquitoes, which become so annoying
that it is often necessary to burn a powder <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>p112</span>
called <i>buhack</i> all night long, in addition to having the
regular mosquito netting over the bed.</p>

<p>About a half a mile outside of Waikaiea River is
a small island a mile in circumference, called Cocoanut
Island. On this island is a family of native fishermen
who still cling to the old way of fishing with
spears, instead of hook and line, and they never employ
the large nets used by the oriental fishermen.
Instead, they use a small hand net, so that they can
catch the particular kind of fish they want. They will
not eat an ordinary fish, but they have their favourite
variety, which are hard to catch.</p>

<p>Fish are so plentiful here that a child can catch as
many as it wants. Even a Kanaka child would eat
only certain kinds, but to the <i>Snark's</i> crew they all
tasted alike; and we ate whatever we could catch—even
shark, and the tentacles of the octopus.</p>

<p>On one side of Cocoanut Island is a large sandy
beach that is fine for surf bathing. On the other side,
the large lava rocks go almost straight down, making
a fine place for diving. Nearly every afternoon I
would go over to the island for a swim, and usually had
the whole beach to myself, except Sundays, when the
island was crowded with bathers. One day, on going
to my favourite lava rocks, off which the diving was
fine, I found the place occupied by a person whom I
had never seen before. I was so surprised that I
could only stand and stare. She was a full-blooded
Hawaiian girl, and from what I could see of her she <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>p113</span>
was good-looking, too. Of course, I could not let a
chance like this go to waste, so I made several photographs
of her, and when I asked her to stand I was
more than sure she was good-looking. She did not
like to stand with the sun shining in her eyes, so we
hunted a shady spot, and I used up the rest of the
film in my camera.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

</div>

<p>But it must not be supposed for a minute that the
native girls are the only good-looking girls in Hilo.
Some of the Japanese girls with whom I had a photographing
acquaintance were as <i>chic</i> as are to be found
any place. One in particular, who was head saleslady
for the Hilo Drug Company, was not at all bad-looking.
To see these little Japanese girls gliding
through the streets—gliding, for their walk is such
a funny little trot that that is the only word to describe
it—I say, to see them gliding along makes a man
ashamed of his own uncouthness when he chances to
meet one of them, and must, for manners' sake, walk
up the street with her. One girl I knew was born in
Hilo, but her parents would not let her wear clothes
of American fashion, so she looked like any native
Japanese, but spoke excellent English. American
clothes usually spoil the looks of a Japanese, for the
Jap form will not take to our garb at all.</p>

<p>These Jap girls do not at first sight seem to be extravagantly
dressed, but for Sunday-and evening-wear,
a Japanese girl's dress will oftentimes cost double the
sum the clothes of a stylish American girl cost. At <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>p114</span>
least, this is what the new cabin-boy we got in Hilo, a
Jap named Nakata, told me, and I suppose he ought
to know.</p>

<p>In the mountains are herds of wild cattle; and near
Hilo are large ranches, where the best cattle country
in the world is found. Here, too, will be seen the only
genuine American cowboy. The cowboys we have in
the States are for exhibition purposes only. But here
the big open valleys and mountains, where the cattle
breed, are so extensive that when the cattle are rounded
up only an expert cowboy would be able to manage
them, for by that time they are nearly as skittish as
the wild cattle. With every round-up, the men say
they catch many wild cattle which have attached themselves
to the ranchman's herd.</p>

<p>Gene and I made long excursions with the launch up
the little creeks and rivers, and always returned with
a load of fruit. Mr. and Mrs. London were staying
with friends in Hilo. The sailor had been discharged,
so that Captain Y——, Gene and I were the only ones
aboard the <i>Snark</i>. We ate at a Chinese restaurant,
and as there was little work to do, we found ample
time for exploring. Gene wore only sleeveless track-shirts
and swimming trunks, and became so sunburned
that wherever exposed, his skin was of almost Ethiopian
blackness, in strange contrast with the protected
skin. During this time I became as black as Gene, but
I seemed to tan all over. Jack did not tan at all; <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>p115</span>
every time he became exposed to the sun he blistered
so badly that often it would lay him up in bed.</p>

<p>Finally, through a mutual agreement between Gene
and Jack, Gene decided that the trip was too much
for his delicate constitution, and Jack decided that he
must consent to Gene's going. So Gene got ready to
go back to San Francisco.</p>

<p>One day I got a call from Jack over the telephone,
telling me that I was promoted to the position of engineer,
and instructing Captain Y—— and me to look
out for a new cook, a new cabin-boy, and a new sailor.
I don't believe I would have traded positions with the
President, or King Edward, that day. I was in a
greater state of excitement than at the time of securing
the position of cook. A Dutchman named Hermann—which
is all the name we ever got out of him—was
secured for the crew of one sailor. Hermann was one
of the real deep-water sailors, of the kind that is rapidly
passing away. He was about the best-natured
fellow I ever worked with; in storm or calm he was
always the same, always singing in one or another of
the half-dozen tongues he could speak. We secured
the cook and cabin-boy at the same time. Wada, a
Japanese, could speak fluent English, and was a very
good cook. He had been in almost every large port
in the world. Nakata, whom we hired for cabin-boy,
was likewise Japanese, and could not speak a word of
English. All we could understand of his vocabulary <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>p116</span>
was <i>pau</i>, which means finished, and <i>pilikea</i>, which
means trouble. But when Nakata reached Australia,
one year and a half later, he could speak very passable
English, and could write quite well.</p>

<p>The principal photographer in Hilo was a young
Chinese boy, who did excellent work. He used to
make pictures of the <i>Snark</i> to sell; and wherever Jack
went, the Chink would be on hand to photograph him.
In the end, Jack could only get rid of the boy by consenting
to pose for a number of pictures, which were
afterward published in a Chinese magazine, with certain
descriptive text beneath each one. I have no
doubt Jack is a very big man in their eyes.</p>

<p>The time was rapidly nearing for us to leave. The
engines were in good repair, we had fuel and provisions
aboard, and practically every one of us was anxious
to be off. Our way led now to the Marquesas
Islands; and the trip, sixty-one days across the trackless
Pacific, in which we sailed four thousand miles in
order to advance two thousand miles, was to prove the
greatest adventurous event of my life. And it ended
by our landing in the world's Garden of Eden.</p>

<p>But before going further with the voyage, I must
devote some consideration to one island of the Hawaiian
group to which as yet no attention has been
directed, Molokai, the Leper Island.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br />
MOLOKAI, THE LEPER ISLAND</h2>
<p class="toclink"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></p>
<p>In telling of Molokai, the Leper Island, I might as
well confess at the outset that I was never on it. But
Jack London was, and everything here set forth was
gotten direct from him or from others who had intimate
knowledge whereof they spoke. Not many persons,
outside the officials of the Board of Health, have
ever been allowed to leave the island of Molokai, once
they had entered the Settlement. Dr. Pinkham, president
of the Board of Health, who has the entire managing
of the island, was an ardent admirer of the literary
works of Jack London; and he so managed it
that both the Londons were allowed to visit Molokai,
in order that Mr. London might properly describe the
life on this island, and thus correct the Kanaka notion
that Molokai is a place of torture. Dr. Pinkham's
decision was a wise one. Much has been written in
the past of the horrors of the Leper Settlement, but
almost without exception these expositions have been
wild and lurid—as London put it, the work of sensationalists,
most of whom had never laid eyes on a single
one of the things they described in such exaggerated and
undependable detail. But there are a great many persons
among English-speaking peoples who have learned
that Jack London always tells the truth as he sees it. <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>p118</span>
Dr. Pinkham knew that if London were to go to the
Settlement, his account of it would present conditions
as they actually are, not as they are shown to be in the
distorted articles of the yellow press. And so, permission
was granted.</p>

<p>But when I tried to follow, the doctor, though my
very good friend, stopped me. He could not take me
to the island of Molokai, because he had no excuse for
doing so. I was not a noted writer—I was merely
a sightseer; and to take a sightseer to Molokai would
have lost him his position. For that matter, the Hawaiian
citizens and the Honolulu press did criticise
him severely for taking Mr. and Mrs. London to the
island.</p>

<p>But while I have never seen the lepers in their Settlement,
I have seen hundreds of cases of leprosy all
through the South Seas. Furthermore, I have discussed
the disease and the managing of Molokai with
Dr. Pinkham, than whom surely there could be no
better source of information. Leprosy was a constant
topic of conversation, morning, noon, and night,
with the little crew of voyageurs on the <i>Snark</i>; we were
all deeply interested; and of this, as of every other
island subject, Jack London had almost encyclopædic
knowledge. In fact, leprosy was his hobby; he was
an untiring defender of segregation. What of my own
experiences, and the memory of other men's experiences,
and what of all that Jack London told me at
this time, there has been bred in me a profound conviction <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>p119</span>
that my own knowledge of leprosy is considerable—certainly
greater than that of many who live
all their lives within a stone's throw of Molokai. In
the very nature of the thing, I was bound to learn,
and learn more than could any ordinary tourist, even
though my actual observation might not extend quite
so far as did the observation of the specialists, the
members of the Board of Health, the executives, and
those visitors, few in number, who have had the privilege
of setting foot within the Leper Settlement.</p>

<p>And so, at the beginning, let me add my testimony
to that of Jack London, in saying that the horrors
with which Molokai is associated in the average mind,
<em>simply do not exist</em>. The sensationalists have done
their work well. To the four corners of the earth
they have disseminated their ghastly fictions, with a
persistency truly wonderful; and the people of every
nation, hungry for things that are gruesome, have
pounced greedily on all that was offered. As a result,
their minds are full-fed with every variety of deceit,
from mere harmless fables to the most inexcusable
lies, and to such an extent that the truth, even when
shown to them, may find little room for lodgment.
Nevertheless, I am optimistic enough to hope that a
pinch of real fact may leaven a mountain of misrepresentation,
and that, in time, the people of every civilised
country will come to know just what sort of place
Molokai is, and just what things take place there.</p>

<p>It is strange that the greatest misapprehension exists <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>p120</span>
among the people of Hawaii. Living next door,
as it were, to the segregated unfortunates, many of
whom have been recruited from their own ranks, it
might be supposed that they would be the very first
to disburden their minds of delusion. Not so. In the
city of Honolulu, there are many who still credit the
idea that Molokai is the place of life-long confinement,
inhuman torture, and melancholy death. The word
"Molokai" spells for them nothing but the most unmerciful
disaster. The very name is enough to send
the hot blood rushing to the heart, and to strike laughter
from the lips. Truly, to their unhappy conception,
Molokai is but the valley of the shadows, wherein
shines never a ray of light to brighten the path of
him who must tread its sombre way.</p>

<p>Much of this sentiment is due to demagogues, who
stir the people constantly with their recital of the
lepers' wrongs. Indignation often runs high when
some particularly outrageous abuse is instanced. The
natives are almost inconceivably credulous, and, unfortunately,
they will not take the trouble to test the
truth of demagogic assertion. However, a campaign
of education has been begun; persons long resident
in the Leper Settlement have been shown by the bacteriological
test to be free from the imputed disease;
and, returned to friends and families, they shatter by
direct evidence the absurd fancies theretofore current.
More and more the value and necessity of segregation
is being impressed upon the Hawaiian natives' minds.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>p121</span></p>

<p>Jack and Mrs. London were at Molokai a week;
they spent the Fourth of July there. I went with
them down to the wharf to catch the leper-steamer,
which makes weekly trips. It is almost always sure
of at least one passenger, from the receiving station
at Kalihi, where suspects are put through the bacteriological
examination; and of course Superintendent
McVeigh is usually on board, to take charge of the
lepers and see them safely to the island.</p>

<p>A number of new lepers were to go that day, and
the wharf was crowded with friends and relatives,
come down to say the good-byes and to see the poor
patients off. It was not a happy sight. I shall never
forget it. Such stormy scenes of grief are terrible.
Men and women and children were there; and on the
faces of those who were to stay was great sadness,
on the faces of those who were to go sadness and
something more: a sick look, a lurking dread in their
eyes, a pallor not natural to human flesh. As the time
drew near for departure, a sudden stir came over the
crowd; grief grew more vociferous. The babel of
voices, hitherto somewhat subdued, rose first to a hum
and then into a sharp murmur. Somewhere a rich
native voice, low-pitched and beautiful, began softly
singing the song of farewell. <i>Aloha oe</i>—<i>aloha oe</i>,
was the refrain. Wheresoever the departing lepers
might roam, through all their days of enforced segregation
from those who loved them and whom they
loved, affection and best wishes would be with them.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>p122</span></p>

<p>Then came the bustle of going aboard; last handclasps;
tears; voices that shook with emotion; and
though the sad hearts could not be seen nor heard,
their beat somehow found its way into the scene;
misery bound the many hearts into one, and their pulse
was united by some mighty bond of sympathy. A
harsh cry from the steamer now stirred everyone into
action; the lepers broke sorrowfully away from their
friends and families, whose grief burst out anew, and
hurried aboard. Such was the parting—not a happy
thing to see, not a thing one can forget.</p>

<p>At this point I was compelled to go back to the
<i>Snark</i>, leaving Mr. and Mrs. London to make the
trip to Molokai on the leper-boat. Two hours must
elapse ere their arrival. Jack carried with him his
camera, and took a number of unique and interesting
pictures of the island and its inhabitants. Some of
these pictures are here reproduced.</p>

<p>As the leper-boat approached the island, he secured
some good views of its rocky coast. Owing to the
fact that there is no anchorage close up, the leper-steamer
must stand on and off a half-mile from shore,
and the landing is made by shooting the surf, through
a very dangerous passage, to a little wharf that extends
about two hundred feet out into the channel.
As they came near, a sound of music floated to them
over the water. The return of Superintendent McVeigh
is always considered an occasion for rejoicing,
among the lepers. A number of the leper men and <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>p123</span>
women, gathered on the beach, play stringed instruments
and sing happy songs to make the arrival of the
new lepers as pleasant as possible.</p>

</div>

<p>Jack told me afterward that it was much different
from what he had expected. He, too, had fed his
mind on the writings of the sensationalists. Once
he had read an account which told of Superintendent
McVeigh (his host on this occasion) crouching in a
grass hut and surrounded by lepers wailing through
the night for food, which the cruel superintendent
withheld. The funny part of it, Jack explained, was
that Superintendent McVeigh's house was not of grass,
but of wood, and the lepers, well-fed and comfortable,
did no wailing at all, but were remarkably happy and
contented folk, following their various chosen pursuits
by day, or loafing if they desired, and filling the
night with the melodious music of their <i>ukeleles</i>,
banjos, guitars, violins, and other stringed instruments,
to say nothing of beautiful songs sung by the singing
societies. And another thing: when we were sailing
along the windward side of Molokai on the <i>Snark</i>,
Jack had pointed to the island, and said it was the pit
of hell, the most cursed place on earth. But he never
spoke so after his visit. His eyes were opened.</p>

<p>The Leper Settlement is divided into two main villages.
These are on a peninsula extending from the
north side of the island. To left, right, and front is
the water. At the back towers the giant wall of the
<i>pali</i>, varying from two to four thousand feet in height. <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>p124</span>
Besides the villages, there are a good many seaside
and country homes. Many of the lepers are well-to-do,
owning horses, fishing-boats, buggies, carts, and
other property. One woman is said to have several
good houses, which she rents.</p>

<p>In all, I believe there are over eight hundred souls
on the island. The population is a mixed one. Dr.
Pinkham told me that most of the lepers are Hawaiians,
or part-Hawaiians; next in number come the
Japanese; and the Chinese are third. (It is thought
that the Chinese imported the disease into Hawaii.)
There were also three negroes, a few Portuguese, a
Norwegian, and about seven Americans. Americans,
however, seldom catch the disease, and then almost
always by inoculation. Jack met several of the
American lepers; he afterward mentioned a Major
Lee, once a marine engineer for the Inter Island
Steamship Company, and then working in the new
steam laundry of Molokai; Mr. Bartlett, formerly in
business in Honolulu, now keeper of the Board of
Health store; and another, whose name I have forgotten,
but who was a veteran of the Civil War—a
crack shot—and at that time in his sixty-fifth year.
Then there are the non-lepers. Of these are the
<i>kokuas</i>, or native helpers, and the priests; Protestant
ministers and their wives; the resident physicians, Dr.
Goodhue and Dr. Hollman; the Franciscan Sisters
at Bishop House, and their Jap servants; two principals
and four Brothers at Baldwin House, and several <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>p125</span>
domestics. Superintendent McVeigh's assistant,
Mr. Waiamau, is a pure Hawaiian, himself stricken
with leprosy.</p>

<p>In the two villages there are churches and assembly
halls. Yellow writers to the contrary, there is not a
grass house in the Settlement. The buildings are of
wood and stone, and are very comfortable. There
are stores for such as care to engage in business.
Some of the lepers fish, others farm; there are splendid
grassy pastures for the horses, which roam by hundreds
in the mountains. The lepers have their fishing-boats
and a steam launch. Again, there are painters
and carpenters. Almost every trade is followed—even
stock-raising and dairying are carried on.
There are artisans of every variety. In such a large
gathering of men and women and children, there is
of course great diversity of taste and ability. Usually,
those who have been actively engaged before coming
to Molokai prefer to follow the same pursuits after
their arrival.</p>

<p>But let it be emphasised that not one of these people
needs work unless he elects to do so. Being wards
of the Territory of Hawaii, all things necessary to life
and comfort are supplied to them free. If, by their
own efforts, they are able to make a few dollars, they
are just that much ahead of the game. Lepers who
live outside the two villages draw from the government
a fixed amount of money as a "clothes ration
order," in addition to a weekly allowance in provisions. <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>p126</span>
Of course, many of the lepers have property elsewhere,
from which they derive an income; and some
of them are looked after by friends.</p>

<p>There are over seven hundred buildings in the Settlement.
Among them are the six churches: two
Protestant, two Mormon, and two Catholic. The
Young Men's Christian Association building is particularly
good. The lepers even have an electric
plant, and a <i>poi</i> factory, to say nothing of a courthouse
and jail.</p>

<p>Social life is brisk on Molokai. An athletic club
has been founded; also glee clubs. Weekly band concerts
are given in the pavilion. On the afternoon of
the Fourth of July, Jack and Mrs. London had the
pleasure of seeing a merry parade, and were appointed
the judges at a horse-race. On the morning after
their arrival, they attended a shoot of the Kaluapapa
Rifle Club. On the day the Londons climbed the
two-thousand-foot <i>pali</i> and looked their last upon the
Settlement, an exciting baseball game, played by the
doctors, the lepers and the non-lepers, was in progress,
on a very good baseball diamond. There are even
visitors' houses, kept clean of disease, where, at certain
intervals, the lepers may meet such of their
friends, relatives, or business agents, as come to see
them. And when one adds to all this the consideration
that Molokai enjoys a better climate than even
Honolulu, it will be seen that the Leper Settlement cannot
be such a very terrible place after all.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>p127</span></p>

<p>After the Londons returned to Honolulu, many persons
expressed amazement at their temerity in venturing
wilfully among the afflicted of Molokai. They
had not even held aloof from the lepers, nor worn
long gloves; instead they had shaken hands with scores
of them. To such of the staid people of Honolulu
as still clung to their chamber-of-horrors notion, the
act was the very height of foolhardiness. It was inconceivable.
But among the more intelligent Hawaiians,
no such horror of leprosy obtains. They realise
how feebly contagious it is. In the Settlement, lepers
and non-lepers mingle freely; at a shoot of the Kalaupapa
Rifle Club, the same guns are used by those
afflicted and those free from the disease; in horse-racing,
the same horses are ridden by all; and in baseball
games, bats, gloves, and masks are freely exchanged.
Not easily does the <i>bacillus leprae</i> pass from body to
body. Only is there danger when one has open wounds
which might come in contact with leprous flesh. The
usual precaution, after being with lepers, is the washing
with antiseptic soap, and the changing of clothing.
And as to the Londons' trip, two very important things
were accomplished by it. In the first place, Jack's
longing to see the much-talked-of leper retreat was
satisfied; and that meant much. And secondly—more
important—probably the first detailed and absolutely
truthful account of the Settlement was given
to the world in the article Jack wrote soon after, entitled
"The Lepers of Molokai." That article, now <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>p128</span>
reprinted in his "Cruise of the <i>Snark</i>," covers so
thoroughly this visit to Molokai that it is needless for
me to say much more concerning it. But my own observations
as to leprosy in the other islands of the
Territory of Hawaii, and the many things told me by
the better-informed class of natives, may not be without
value.</p>

<p>Segregation is imperative. By its means, leprosy is
on the wane in Hawaii. When a person is suspected
of the disease, he is summoned to Kalihi, in the outskirts
of Honolulu and put through a thorough bacteriological
test. If the <i>bacillus leprae</i> is found, after
a careful examination by the bacteriologist, the suspect
is further examined by a Board of physicians appointed
for the purpose; and if he is pronounced a leper, preparations
are made for taking him to Molokai. Plenty
of time is given him in which to administer his business
affairs. Every courtesy is shown. And after
being sent to Molokai, he has the privilege of being
again examined, at any time, by competent authority,
to determine the exact condition of his disease.</p>

<p>As I have said, leprosy is very feebly contagious.
But throughout the world, there is widespread fear
of it. Considering the horribleness of the disease—for
horrible it is, beyond the power of the most unprincipled
inkster to exaggerate—and its absolutely
incurable character, one cannot wonder much at the
sentiment existing among all peoples in countries where <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>p129</span>
any of its forms are known. To be pronounced a
leper seems, to the average person, virtually to be pronounced
dead. But not decently dead! Were it so,
the added horrors would not be there. No, the leper's
death seems many times more dreadful than mere
ordinary dissolution, because of its slowness and the
awful form it assumes. The average person shrinks
from death, but absolutely recoils from the same dark
thing when it dons the robe of this, of all diseases
the most foul. Furthermore, some deaths are swift—mercifully
swift, and not unlovely. Leprosy is
usually slow, vile, hideous. One dies by inches. Terrible
in contemplation, what must it be when fastened
insidiously upon one's flesh!</p>

<p>But no more of this, lest I, too, be adjudged one
of the purveyors of things needlessly dreadful. But
remember this: when Jack London, or I, or any other
man, says that the horrors of the Molokai leper life
have been exaggerated, it is not meant that the disease
itself has been exaggerated. No one denies that
leprosy is an awful thing. But anyone who has
ever seen the leper colony of Molokai, or knows
anything about it, will most strenuously deny that the
conditions under which these people live are bad.
Jack said, on his return to the <i>Snark</i>, that, given his
choice between living out his days in any one of those
"cesspools of human misery and degradation," the
East End of London, the East Side of New York, or <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>p130</span>
the Stockyards of Chicago, or going to stay in Molokai,
he would, without hesitation, with gratitude even,
choose Molokai.</p>

<p>For he knows that the people of Molokai are
happy. They live at ease, <em>while they live</em>. But not
so the people of the other places. Theirs is one long,
mad struggle for mere existence; life is a turmoil, a
riot, a nightmare. On Molokai, food is plenty. No
fight is there. The days are peaceful and the nights
are happy. All is music and beautiful scenes; fresh
breezes are always blowing from over the sea. The
men and women of Molokai do not freeze through a
bitter-cold winter, nor do they swelter in a raging
summer's heat. While they live, they live in Paradise.
No wonder Jack London knew, without debate, which
place he would choose.</p>

<p>The lepers themselves are satisfied—and what
better testimony could be asked? Since the bacteriological
test was put into effect, a number of persons
once declared lepers and sent to Molokai have been
found to be wholly clean of the disease, and been returned
to their homes. They have never ceased bewailing
their expulsion from Molokai. "Back to
Molokai," is the lament of all who have once tasted
of the island's delights and then been shut out from
them.</p>

<p>One of the most unfortunate things about leprosy
in the Territory of Hawaii is the fact that the friends
and relatives of lepers so often hide them away when <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>p131</span>
the disease first appears, and keep them hidden until
they are in a terrible condition. One day, when I
was walking along a little-frequented part of the beach,
not far from Pearl City, on the island of Oahu, I
saw a small child playing near the water. As I drew
near, its mother came rushing toward it, gathered it
up in her arms, and ran to her hut, about fifty yards
away. At the time I was puzzled, but I was afterward
told, in confidence, that the child was a leper,
and that the mother was determined to keep it from
the attention of the Board of Health.</p>

<p>It is best for the lepers themselves that they be
taken to the Settlement, where they can receive proper
medical treatment. Outside, they can do nothing but
lie and await inevitable death. But in the Settlement,
the surgeons can make occasional operations, and hold
off the ravages indefinitely. Some lepers, stricken in
their youth, have lived happy lives, and died of old
age, when thus protected. Leprosy is very intermittent
in its action; after once appearing and being
treated, it may not show itself again for years. But
if not treated, it gallops.</p>

<p>I well remember the case of a leper in the United
States a few years ago. The newspapers exploited
the case sensationally, but I think there was nevertheless
an element of truth in what they printed. The
leper was a tramp. How he had contracted the disease,
no one knew. But it is said that he lived altogether
in a box-car. This car he was never allowed <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>p132</span>
to leave. The railway company was desperate. Time
and again they tried to force him out at different stations,
but each time the men of the town cried a veto
to the scheme. Thousands of miles that leper tramp
travelled. In the whole country, there was no spot
of earth big enough for him to set his foot on. In
the box-car he was, and in the box-car he must remain.
Not that he starved. People flung food to him as they
fling food to dogs; also, there were occasional donations
of clothing, reached out to him on long poles
At last the railway company, grown doubly desperate,
hit upon an expedient. They unhooked the car one
night, and left it standing on a siding, about a mile
from a little mining village. But the trick failed.
The next freight that pulled up that way was met by
several hundred black-looking men, armed with rifles;
and when that train pulled out, it carried with it the
leper's box-car and the leper. I never heard what became
of the car, nor of its occupant. But the story
was a gruesome thing, and well illustrates the difference
between a leper's fare outside the Settlement, and
inside the Settlement.</p>

</div>

<p>Now as to leprosy itself. No one knows what it is.
It is classified according to its manifestations. Delve
we never so far into the remoteness of antiquity, we
will find records of leprosy. Fifteen hundred years
before Christ, it was widely known in the delta and
valley of the Nile. It flourished throughout the Middle
Ages. To-day it is common in Asia, Africa, South <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>p133</span>
America, the West Indies, and certain isolated localities
of Europe. Little was known of it in the ancient
days; but little is known of it now. It is parasitic—that
much is certain. Dr. Armauer Hansen discovered
the <i>bacillus leprae</i> in 1871, but no one has gotten
much further than that. Its only alleviation is surgery,
but this is sometimes without avail. Leprosy is of three
well-defined kinds: There is Running Leprosy, the
most horrible of the three. It shows itself mainly as
shiny ulcers, which throw off a highly offensive perspiration.
In this kind, the fingers, ears, nose, and
eyes are often eaten away, leaving a hideous bundle
of flesh that but faintly resembles a human being.
Dry Leprosy, the second variety, does not take such
an offensive form. It resembles a very bad case of
eczema, affecting the feet and the hands more than any
other part of the body. The skin becomes thick and
reddened, while the fleshy part rapidly disappears,
leaving the fingers crooked and hard, like claws. The
third kind is known as Nervous or Anæsthetic Leprosy.
The nerves of the body cease to do their work and become
so deadened that a finger could be scraped to the
bone with a nutmeg-grater without the least pain. This
kind of leprosy makes its victim appear gnarled and
twisted as with rheumatism.</p>

<p>The period of incubation is not definitely known.
Probably it is some years. Now and then, however,
there is a case in which the disease develops with great
rapidity, and is steady in its ravages. Various internal <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>p134</span>
remedies have been tried, among them chaulmoogra
oil, arsenic, salicylate of soda, salol, and chlorate of
potash. While these prove of efficacy in some cases,
there has never been a well-authenticated case of cure.
Years may pass before the proper remedial agent shall
have been discovered.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting spots in the island is
the grave of Father Damien, the name in religion of
Joseph de Veuster. In the days when segregation on
Molokai was first being tried out, many of the lepers
sent to the island were in an advanced stage of the
disease and were consequently helpless. Being unable
to take care of themselves, they lived in misery
for years. Some of the deported unfortunates were
too feeble to build themselves grass houses, and lived
like wild beasts, anywhere they could find shelter. At
this time, the young Belgian missionary, Father Damien,
undertook to assume spiritual charge over the
lepers. He worked for several years in the Settlement,
and with his own hands built huts for those unable
to build their own. He nursed the advanced
cases, and with the help of the stronger lepers dug
drainage canals, and took off the malarial water which
had been a curse up to this time. He asked small donations
from the government, which were reluctantly
given, and he persuaded several other priests and two
nuns to help him, and gradually built up the present
sanitary Settlement, which has more perfect conditions <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>p135</span>
for sick people than any sanitarium, hospital, or detention
camp in the world.</p>

<p>After about ten years of the most noble work any
missionary ever attempted, Father Damien contracted
leprosy, and for the next twelve years was not allowed
to leave the island. But he carried out the work he
started, and during the last months of his life, when he
was one mass of gnarled, decaying flesh, he lay in his bed
directing that his work go on as it had when he was
well to oversee it. And on the day that he died, he
asked to be brought out in the open air, that he might
see the fruit of his labours—the thing for which he had
given up his life. To-day, none can deny this man
honour. He was a hero. By his sacrifice, he has
been and will be for years to come the means of saving
the lives of others. The United States government
gladly took up the work that he laid down unfinished,
and Molokai is now better managed than Father
Damien, in his most optimistic dreams, might have
hoped. It is good to know that when, not long after,
a calumniator took up his pen to make light of the
work of the dead priest, and to vilify him personally,
Robert Louis Stevenson, himself a great writer and
a great man, was there with all his energy in the defense.</p>

<p>Leprosy is often accompanied by elephantiasis; in
fact, some medical authorities use the terms synonymously
for the same disease. All through the South <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>p136</span>
Seas, where lepers and elephantiasis victims mingle
with the other natives in their villages, the ones afflicted
with elephantiasis are looked upon with more horror
than the ones with leprosy, as the natives say elephantiasis
is more catching, and that it develops more
rapidly. At one island I was on, in the Society Group,
it is estimated that one-tenth of the population has elephantiasis,
or <i>fey-fey</i>, as they call it. Leprosy is
not painful until it reaches an acute stage, but elephantiasis
is accompanied by considerable pain from
the first forming of the tumor, which tumor sometimes
weighs one hundred pounds.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that I have not attempted a full
description of leprosy. The symptoms once set forth,
I fear certain of my impressionable readers might begin
to experience them, just as hypochondriacs, after
reading a patent-medicine almanac, appropriate to
themselves all the diseases therein described. The
doctors have enough to do; far be it from me to add
to their troubles a swarm of pseudo-leprosy cases.
Besides, such an enumeration could do no good.
These things are depressing. Let us forget them, or,
at least, the worst of them.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />
THE LONG TRAVERSE</h2>
<p class="toclink"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></p>
<p>"It will be a long traverse."</p>

<p>"Yes, but what of that? The <i>Snark</i> is equal to it,
and so are we."</p>

<p>"It will be a difficult traverse."</p>

<p>"So much the better."</p>

<p>Jack and Mrs. London were sitting at the cabin
table, poring over their maps and planning the further
voyage of the <i>Snark</i>.</p>

<p>"The Marquesas Islands lie two thousand miles
away, as the crow flies," Jack went on. "But there
are a good many things to reckon with. It will not
be all plain sailing. Let's see—we mustn't cross
the Line west of 130° west longitude. To do so
might get us entangled with the southeast trades, and
throw us so far to leeward of the islands that we
couldn't make them. Then there's the equatorial current
to be considered, and a few other things. But
we'll do it. We'll do it."</p>

<p>Mrs. London glanced across the table at him and
nodded her assent.</p>

<p>"October 7, then, is the day," Jack announced; and
we set to work.</p>

<p>Again we were kept busy almost up to the hour of
sailing. The boat was provisioned and fuel put <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>p138</span>
aboard. We stowed away vegetables, salt-horse, codfish,
salt pork, canned goods, potatoes, and a hundred
and one things. We expected that it would take us at
least two months to make our next anchorage, and
possibly longer. The element of uncertainty was
large, what of the storms and calms we must look for.
But we were confident of making fair speed, for had
we not a powerful gasolene engine with which to cheat
the wind?</p>

<p>During the wait, we ordered a full wardrobe of clothing
made, as we could hardly expect to find any stores
down in the South Seas. Our working clothes were
made like a Japanese fisherman's knee-trousers and
sleeveless shirts, but the most comfortable dress for
lounging was Japanese kimonos. My kimonos were
made by two Hilo friends, in the latest Japanese
fashion; and by the time we were ready to sail, I had
a large camphor-wood chest full of clothing.</p>

<p>Gene Fenelon left on the little island steamer
<i>Keaneau</i> on the same day that we sailed from Hilo.
We had made many friends in Hilo, and on the day
of our departure, the wharf was crowded with the
most cosmopolitan gathering that ever assembled to
see a ship off. Here again the people prophesied that
we would never reach port, for this voyage was considered
the most foolhardly we could attempt. But
we were not to be deterred. We were looking for
Adventure and trying to see the out-of-the-way places <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>p139</span>
that other people did not see, and, naturally, we
wanted to make a trip that others could not make.</p>

<p>Before quitting land, I packed up a box of curios
I had purchased in the Islands, and shipped it by
steamer back to the States. Good fortune had attended
my buying. In the box were reed sofa-pillows, deerskin
rugs, an Aloha Nui (a pillow signifying lots and
lots of good luck), a grass water-carrier, poisoned arrows,
hooks used by natives in catching devil-fish, one
tapa <i>hula</i> blanket, <i>hula</i> dresses, calabash dishes, native
combs, opium pipes, and other interesting things.
Jack and I determined from then on to get all the
curios we could. Captain X—— had once assured
us that down in the South Sea isles the natives would
trade their very souls for gaudy cloth or for trinkets,
so we laid in a big supply of red handkerchiefs, bolts
of cheap but brilliant-hued calico, and worthless
pocket-knives. I even sent back word to the jewellery
store in Independence to have a consignment of
highly polished "junk" jewellery shipped ahead of me
to the Society Islands.</p>

<p>At last came the hour for our start. I think we
all had deep regrets at leaving Hawaii. The months
spent there had been happy ones, and it was a sorrow
to part with our friends. In Honolulu, the Elks had
been particularly kind to me, even giving me a letter
to put with the two I had previously received. It
seemed to me as I stood on the <i>Snark's</i> deck taking <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>p140</span>
my last look at Hawaiian territory that I could subscribe
heartily to the words of Mark Twain: "No
alien land in all this world has any deep, strong charm
for me but that one; no other land could so longingly
and beseechingly haunt me, sleeping and waking,
through half a lifetime, as that one has done; other
things leave me, but it abides; other things change,
but it remains the same; for me its balmy airs are always
blowing, its summer seas flashing in the sun; the
pulsing of its surf-beat is in my ear; I can see its garlanded
craigs, its leaping cascades, its plumy palms
drooping the shore; its remote summits floating like
islands above the cloud-rack; I can feel the spirit of its
woodland solitudes; I can hear the plash of its brooks;
in my nostrils still lives the breath of its flowers that
perished twenty years ago."</p>

<p>It was just after dinner on the 7th of October
that I started the engine; the shore lines were cast off,
and amid the cheers of our friends we slowly turned
our bow to the south, and one of the most remarkable
cruises ever attempted had begun. We ran along the
coast of Hawaii until nearly sunset; then the course
was set to southeast, and by dark we were out of sight
of land. I stopped the engines and went on deck to
enjoy the pleasant evening. It was a strange sight
that met my gaze. Jack and Mrs. London, Nakata
and Wada were all leaning over the rail, as seasick a
crew as ever I have seen, and Captain Y——, our
full-fledged deep-water captain, gave up the wheel to <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>p141</span>
Hermann just as I came on deck, and joined them.
Hermann and I sat back in the cockpit and made remarks
about people with weak stomachs coming to
sea. And I started to enjoy myself at their expense.
But gradually the sea got rougher, and I began to feel
queer; then I stopped enjoying myself and went below
to bed, while Hermann called down sarcastic things
from above.</p>

<p>During the next week, not much work was done
aboard this ship. The wind was gradually becoming
lighter, and we knew we were nearing the doldrums,
or horse latitudes. The air was growing warmer, so
that we all slept on deck; and when the weather was
not too rough, we would place large canvas windsails
below and catch all the fresh air there was.</p>

<p>Jack was writing a new book. While in Honolulu,
he had told me of it, and he was then preparing his
notes for it.</p>

<p>"Look here, Martin," he called to me one day, at
the Seaside Hotel.</p>

<p>I came to where he was sitting.</p>

<p>"Look at this," he directed, holding out a sheet of
paper. "There's the title of something new I'm going
to write. And I'm going to make you half-hero
of it, what's more."</p>

<p>I looked at the paper. On it was the title, "Martin
Eden."</p>

<p>Jack then went on to explain. The name was a combination.
Jack had used my Christian name and the <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>p142</span>
surname of an old friend of his called Eden. The
story, he said, would be drawn largely from his own
experience; it would treat of the struggles of a young
fellow who was determined to "make good" at writing;
of his eventual success; and of his unhappy death.
But it was to be more than a story. Through it was
to run a certain cosmic undertone that would make
of it a record of universal truths. Beyond the mere
recital of details incident to the plot would be a biological
and sociological significance. The thing would
be true, not only of Martin Eden, but of all life,
of all time. In a way, a value would be put upon life
and the things of life that would ring true, even though
the view-point would not be that of the smug bourgeoisie.</p>

<p>When he was not too sick, Jack worked on this
book. I think he found much pleasure in it. Of evenings,
if the weather was fair, we would assemble on
deck, and Jack would read aloud to us that day's instalment.
Besides this, we had the five hundred books
of the <i>Snark's</i> library to draw upon, so that we never
lacked for reading.</p>

<p>But fair weather or foul, one thing was continual.
The roll of the boat was always present. The lunge,
the dip, the surge—over and over, never changing,
never ceasing. Body and brain, we rocked. Strange
antics the horizon line played, shifting in all manner of
angles. Sometimes there was no horizon line—great
towering waves would blot it out, interposing their <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>p143</span>
foam-capped crests in leaps and tumbles, swelling and
subsiding.</p>

<p>Finally, after about three weeks of slow sailing, the
wind played out altogether, leaving us rolling on a
glassy sea for another three weeks. We kept our
head turned to the east as much as possible when there
was breeze enough to steer, and sometimes I would run
the engines for a few hours, but we were saving with
the gasolene, as we feared we would be unable to get
any more for a long time to come. Every time I had
the engines running I noticed that they seemed to
decrease in power, until finally they were not developing
half the speed they should. On going over them,
I found that the exhaust-pipe had been connected up
wrongly. The engines' being below the water-line allowed
the water to run back into the cylinders, causing
them to rust, and naturally they lost power. After
showing Jack the trouble, I suggested that it would be
better to shut down the engines entirely until we got
to a place where we could get the exhaust-pipe changed;
he agreed with me, and for the rest of this trip we
were compelled to depend solely on the sails.</p>

<p>The Sailing Directions for the South Pacific says:</p>

<blockquote title="Sailing Directions for the South Pacific">
<p>Sandwich Islands to Tahiti.—There is great difficulty
in making this passage across the trades. The
whalers and all others speak with great doubt of fetching
Tahiti from the Sandwich Islands. Capt. Bruce
says that a vessel should keep to the northward until
she gets a start of the wind before bearing for her <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>p144</span>
destination. In his passage between them in November,
1837, he had no variables near the line in coming
south, and never could make easting on either tack,
though he endeavoured by every means to do so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The variables we encountered in 11° north latitude.
This was a stroke of real luck. The variables were
our hope; without them the traverse would be maddeningly
impossible. We stayed in the immediate
neighbourhood of 11° north latitude.</p>

<p>The variables were extremely uncertain. Now we
would have a fair gust of wind, just sufficient to raise
our spirits and set us betting on the speed such a wind
made possible; and now all wind would die away, leaving
us almost motionless on the smooth sea. It was
in such moments of despair that we realised the immensity
of the task we had set for ourselves. In
years and years, no vessel had attempted to cross the
Pacific in this particular waste; several vessels had tried
it, but they had either been blown far out of their
course and landed in the Samoan or Fiji Islands, or
else had never been heard from again. A grim possibility
stared us in the face. What if all winds failed
us; what if progress were impossible; what if we were
doomed to sail and drift in this deserted ocean space for
months and months, until death put an end to our
sufferings? It might happen. Who could tell?</p>

<p>But all things come to those who dare. We had
dared mightily. And mightily we reaped of our sowing.
We did the impossible. We cheated the chances, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>p145</span>
we defeated the odds that lay against us. The <i>Snark</i>
and crew put in safely to Taiohae Bay, in the Marquesas
Islands, sixty-one days out of Hilo, Hawaii.</p>

<p>By the time we were calmed in the doldrums we
were all seasoned seamen; and I never again saw one
of the crew seasick.</p>

<p>From the time we left Hilo up to now, we had made
no effort to catch the fish that were so thick on every
side of us, but now that we were feeling fine and enjoying
life, we each got our fishing tackle and started to
fish. When there was no wind, we lowered the sails
and spread the awning—there was no use letting the
sails tear themselves to threads by flapping around
while the ship rolled. It did not take us long to become
expert in fishing, for we soon learned the kinds
of baits and hooks to use for the different kinds of
fish. We vied with one another to see which could
catch the greatest number. One of us need only say
that he would bet fifty cents or a dollar that he could
catch a certain kind and amount of fish in less time
than any other person aboard could perform the feat,
and everyone would start in with hook and line. I've
seen Jack London throw aside "Martin Eden" and
join us. Often Jack would come up on deck, and say:
"See that big fish over there, the one with the spot
on his back"—or any other way to distinguish a
particular fish—"Well, I'll wager I can catch him
inside of five minutes." I would take him up, and
then his sport would begin, trying to keep from catching <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>p146</span>
other fish when only a particular one was wanted.
Some idea of the trouble he had will be conveyed when
I say that I have seen thousands and thousands of fish,
anywhere from one to fifteen feet long, on every side
of the <i>Snark</i>. It was no longer sport merely to catch
fish—we must catch some particular fish. One variety,
the dolphin, the prettiest fish in the world, we
would try for with rod and reel and sometimes a
quarter of a mile of line. This fish we could easily
harpoon, but that would not have been sport. We
caught many sharks, from which we used to cut out
steaks and throw the bodies overboard. Hermann, like
all deep-water fishermen, wanted to pull the sharks
aboard and cut off their tails and then throw them,
alive, overboard; for a sailor hates a shark worse than
anything in the world, and will never miss a chance
to torture one. At last Jack gave orders that no more
sharks were to be caught, for they dirtied up the deck,
and besides, some of the larger ones had broken up
things on the deck with their tails. A large shark
could easily kill a person with a well-directed blow
of the tail. But it was interesting to see the different
species of shark. Further along we found a number
of different kinds.</p>

<p>An interesting thing about a shark is the way it
turns on its back to bite. The mouth is set back under
the nose, so that the shark must turn clear over
with the white stomach upward in order to feed itself.
Another remarkable thing about a shark is its <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>p147</span>
almost unbelievable vitality. I have cut out a shark's
heart and let it lie in a dish, where I have timed it to
beat for two hours. Up on deck, the shark itself
would be flopping and twisting—through some muscular
reaction, I suppose.</p>

<span class="caption">Santa Cruz Natives in Catamaran Canoes
 <a class="imglst" href="#ILLUSTRATIONS">Imglst</a></span>
</div>

<p>On board we had a full set of harpoons and granes
with which to catch bonita. The bonita are the swiftest
fish in the sea; no matter how fast the <i>Snark</i> sailed,
they kept up with us without difficulty. Often, if we
would slightly wound a bonita so that the blood would
start, the whole pack would jump on this fish and have
him eaten before we were out of sight. Again, we
have hauled them from the sea with fresh-bitten holes
in their flesh, as big as a teacup. Bonita are called
the cannibals of the sea.</p>

<p>Thousands and thousands of flying fish could be seen.
It was these that lured the bonita. For be it known
that the flying fish are food for many deep-sea creatures,
and for the swooping sea-birds. Incidentally, I
might mention that on occasion they proved also a
delicious diet for the crew of the <i>Snark</i>. Our boat
was continually stirring up the flying fish, causing them
to essay flight, but ever the birds swooped and drove
them into the voracious maws of the bonita.</p>

<p>The sharks we caught by bending chain-swivels on
small rope and attaching big hooks. The shark steaks
were very good to eat, when properly prepared. We
ate also pilot fish, and remoras; in fact, the sea yielded
up its creatures abundantly to our larder. Once we <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>p148</span>
spied a big green sea-turtle, sleeping on the surface
and surrounded by a multitudinous school of bonita.
Hermann got him with granes. That turtle later appeared
on our table, and toothsome he was! I think
he must have weighed a full hundred pounds.</p>

<p>The dolphin proved good sport. We used an entire
flying fish as bait, strung on a tarpon hook. The
dolphin leap and fight and buck in mid-air when caught,
turning the colour of rich gold. Many of them are
heavy, being usually right around four feet in length.</p>

<p>A passenger on a steamer never sees any kind of
fish other than bonita, unless it be an occasional whale
or a school of porpoise, for the swish of the propeller
frightens the fish so no one can ever experience the
real excitement of good fishing at sea, unless he is on
a sailing vessel. And when a fellow tells you of the
fish he has seen from the deck of a steamer, enlarging
upon their extraordinary length, their abundance,
their gorgeous colours, just set that fellow down as a
prevaricator.</p>

<p>In addition to "Martin Eden" Jack wrote on other
work. There were his magazine articles, short stories,
and other things to be attended to. He had now made
up his mind to make a study of the South Sea Islanders,
a fancy which, as the event showed, was never fathered
into action. I have often wished he had had the opportunity
to spend more time among the primitive
people with whom we later came in contact. Jack <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>p149</span>
London, what of his animal stories, or tales of creatures
closely approximating men, yet with all the simplicity
of animals, has often been termed a "primitive
psychologist." Had conditions favoured, I really believe
he would have given to the world some studies of
the strangest creatures in existence, making plain their
mental processes and throwing light upon their manners
and customs in a way never before attempted.
But it was not to be. We were not wanted in the
South Seas, as we were later to be shown.</p>

<p>We drifted at the will of the currents and tides for
a couple of weeks, until we had just about reached the
Equator; then storms were frequent, driving us to
the westward further than we wanted to go. For eight
or ten days we had miserable weather. A squall would
show up on the horizon and a large black cloud sweep
over the sky. Had we been in Kansas and seen such
elemental disturbances, we should have hunted the
storm-cellar. These storms would last from ten
minutes to an hour. The little <i>Snark</i> would lay over
in the sea while salt-water would pour over the decks
and sweep below, leaving everything drenched. Many
times the boat buried her rail and deck, but she did
not turn turtle. The <i>Snark</i> was stanch.</p>

<p>Now entered the first real discomfort. And it was
a serious one. It was November 20, and we were in
the doldrums. It was night, and a storm was raging.
One of the Japanese left a water-tap open that connected <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>p150</span>
the deck tanks, and in the morning not a drop
of water was left in any of the tanks, and only about
ten gallons below.</p>

<p>We did not know what to do. We had been forty-five
days out of the Sandwich Islands, had not sighted
any land or a sail, and were in the uncertain doldrums
and not half-way to the Marquesas Islands. Jack immediately
ordered the remaining ten gallons of water
put under lock and key, and one quart of water per
day was our allowance.</p>

<p>One has no idea how small an amount a quart is
until he is put on such an allowance. Before the middle
of the afternoon, we would have our water drunk.
Our thirst raged. It grew worse because we knew
there was nothing to assuage it. At meals, when tins
of provisions were opened, we tried to buy each other's
share of the liquid from the can.</p>

<p>The days crept by. Our thirst grew almost unbearable.
We spoke of nothing but water. We
dreamed of water. In my sleep, a thousand times I
saw brooks and rivers and springs. I saw sparkling
water run over stones, purling and rippling, and a
thousand times I bent over to take a deep draught,
when—alas! I awoke to find myself lying on the
deck of the <i>Snark</i>, crying out with thirst. And as it
was with me, so was it with the rest of the crew. It
seemed a monstrous thing that there should be no
water. The situation grew more serious with every
passing hour. It seemed such a needless misfortune <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>p151</span>
that had befallen us. We had started out with over a
thousand gallons of the precious fluid—had even installed
extra tanks on deck, that we might be assured
of a sufficiency—and here we were, with a quart a
day apiece! and our thirst raging and crying out in
our throats!</p>

<p>How we longed for rain! None came. At last,
after nearly a week, we saw a storm blowing up, and
black clouds gathering. Here was promise! We
rigged lines on either side, between the main and mizzen
riggings, and from this spread out the large deck
awning, so disposed that it would catch and pour into a
barrel as much water as possible. The storm swept
on toward us. We gazed at it with parted lips.
Gallons of water were descending a few hundred yards
away from us, and the heart of the squall was making
directly for us, while we stood there and exulted. And
then, to our infinite disappointment and dismay, the
squall split, and the two parts drew off away from us.</p>

<p>Twelve hundred miles from land, and no water!</p>

<p>Death leered at us from the dark sea. There
seemed no possible chance for us. And what did
Jack London do?</p>

<p>Almost dead with thirst himself, he went into his
cabin and wrote a sea story about a castaway sailor
that died of thirst while drifting in an open boat.
And when he had finished it he came out, gaunt and
haggard, but with eyes burning with enthusiasm, and
told us of the story and said:
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>p152</span></p>

<p>"Boys, that yarn's one of the best I ever did!"</p>

<p>That night a heavy, soaking tropical rain came on;
we spread the awning again and filled our water tanks;
and as the big barrel ran over with the gurgling water,
Jack said:</p>

<p>"I'll not kill that sailor; I'll have him saved
by a rain like this; that'll make the yarn better than
ever!"</p>

<p>That water was the best we ever tasted. We
couldn't deny it. After seeing that we had a good
supply, we set all the sail we could crowd on the boat
and crossed the Equator. When the sun rose next
morning, and we awoke for the day's duties, we knew
we were out of the doldrums.</p>

<p>During this time Nakata was rapidly picking up
English; in fact, I never saw a person pick up the
language so fast. When asked if he was happy, he
would answer: "I'm happy, happy, happy!"—which
seemed to be the truth, for he was always in
a good humour, and was never too tired to do more
work. Nights, when we would be called out of our
bunks to help on deck during a storm, Nakata would
come up smiling, while the rest of us would come up
grumbling. It has often been noticed how soon a
small party will get grumpy if they are together for a
long time, but we were an exception to the rule; our
days were spent amicably up on deck, and in the evenings
Mr. and Mrs. London and Captain Y—— and
I went below to play cards.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>p153</span></p>

<p>In the diary I kept on this part of the trip, I find
these interesting entries:</p>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Sunday, December 1, 1907.</h3>—Have started studying
Henderson's Navigation. The rest of the crew are
up on deck, watching the fish that keep up with the
<i>Snark</i>. They look like thousands of comets, swimming
so fast that their shapes are not distinguishable.
The way we are gliding along is fine.</div>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Monday, December 2, 1907.</h3>—Sliding along at
seven knots. A large frigate bird followed us all day.
They never go far from land, so we were glad to see
him, for he presages a landfall. The funniest little
mascot has been after us for a week: a little, pale-green
fish, about a foot and a half long, who is having the
hardest time to keep up, wriggling his tail as if it was
awfully hard work to swim so fast. Bonita and dolphin
slide through the water with hardly any exertion,
but this little fish is so hard put that we wonder what
he gets to eat.</div>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Tuesday, December 3, 1907.</h3>—Captain says we are
three hundred and sixty miles from land—and still
going! It is funny to see us crowd around the chart
at noon, as the captain puts our position on it. We
are drawing closer to the islands all the time, until it
seems that we should see them now, they look so close
on the map. Captain, Jack and I got away out on the
flying jib-boom and had a contest to see which would
catch the most bonita. They caught more than I, but
I caught the largest, thirty pound. I must make a <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>p154</span>
picture of the little craft from there; she looks good,
and the spinnaker-boom improves it. Jack discovered
to-day that last Thursday was Thanksgiving. Just one
year ago to-day that I left home to join the crew of
the <i>Snark</i>. Heaven only knows where we will be next
year at this time.</div>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Wednesday, December 4, 1907.</h3>—Still sliding
along. Took off the mizzen sail this afternoon, for
with the wind aft it only cut off the wind from the main
and caused hard steering. Fish were so thick around
us this afternoon that the water looked as if it were
boiling and sounded like a waterfall. The bonita must
have struck a school of small flying fish near the surface.
Captain got out large charts of Nuka-hiva and
the bay we are going into, so we are all excitement; expecting
to sight land to-morrow night. Clothes are
brought out and brushed and aired, and brass is being
scoured up, and still we slide along. Am getting along
well with my navigation.</div>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Thursday, December 5, 1907.</h3>—I just got through
giving Nakata a lesson in English. He knew no
English at all at the start of the voyage, now can understand
most anything told him; talks pretty well,
too. Fish is getting to be a tiresome subject by this
time, but must tell of the thousands of big five to thirty
pound fish leaping in the air and swarming through the
water so that their noise can be heard above the splashing
of the boat here below. Jack shot several, which
were eaten before they could sink—wounded ones <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>p155</span>
eaten alive by their own kind. As we were all leaning
over the stern watching them, two monster sharks appeared,
one at least fifteen feet in length. Then all
the bonita vanished. I have a bet with everyone on
board that I sight land first. It's only about seventy
miles away. How good it will seem after two months
on the <i>Snark</i>! I am going to print pictures up till midnight;
then two hours at the wheel, and if the air
keeps as clear as now, I think I'll win my bets. Got
launch to running just as I was about to give it up.
Now I'm busy painting and oiling it, while Hermann
is painting and varnishing the boat.</div>

<h3>Friday, December 6, 1907.</h3>—Midnight. We are
anchored in the prettiest bay I ever imagined. But
let me begin at the first. My brain is so full of things
to write that I know I will never do them justice, for
I have not the time or paper. Early this morning captain
awoke us with "Land ahoy!" and in the quickest
time anyone ever got on deck we were trying to make
out in the hazy atmosphere <i>land</i>. At last we succeeded.
Ua-huka was straight ahead, and away in
the distance could be seen the ragged crags of Nuka-hiva,
the island we were heading for. How good
those big green mountains looked! Only men who had
been sixty days on the sea could appreciate the scene.
In a few hours we were within three miles of Ua-huka,
seven miles long and thirty-three hundred feet high.
It looked like a big rock. Soon Nuka-hiva loomed up
straight ahead. It seemed as if we were in another <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>p156</span>
world as we sailed past several low cocoanut islands,
sometimes going so close that with the glasses we could
see villages of grass houses, and we knew that at last
we were in the real South Sea islands.</div>

<p>By five o'clock we could make out the two sentinel
rocks, between which we must go to get into the bay.
It was nearly midnight as we sailed up the coast of
Nuka-hiva. A fine bright moon had been shining
earlier in the evening; but just as we had sighted the
opening of the bay (called Taiohae Bay on the chart),
a squall struck us and we were in the most dangerous
position we had ever been caught in: rocks and reefs
on every side, so we could not turn back. We did the
only thing possible—drove right for the place of
which we had sighted the opening, and left to luck that
we would find it. Luck was with us. We sailed in the
opening, just missing a large, rocky island at its mouth.
We passed so close that thousands of sea-birds were
sent crying and frightened off their rocky perch.
After getting inside the bay, the mountains on every
side shut off the storm, and the wind dropped so low
that we were an hour getting from the mouth of the
bay to the upper end, where the water was shallow
enough for anchoring.</p>

<p>At last we are at anchor. It seems that we must
be in paradise. The air is perfume. We can hear
the wild goats blatting in the mountains, and an occasional
long-drawn howl from a dog ashore. It is so
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>p157</span>
near morning now that the cocks are crowing; and we
are so proud of ourselves for doing what the Sailing
Directions said was impossible, and so happy at seeing
land again! Well, now we shall get a much-needed
rest.
 <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>p158</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />
IN THE MARQUESAS</h2>
<p class="toclink"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></p>
<p>At last we were in the real Marquesas Islands, the
islands we had heard so much about, the islands that
very few white people ever see—for here there is
only one way of communicating with the outside world,
and that is by two trading schooners that make four
trips a year from Papeete, Tahiti, one thousand miles
away, and an occasional bark or brig that drops in here
for copra.</p>

<p>When the sun peeped over the mountains, we awoke
to the prettiest sight imaginable. All about, sloping
steeply upward, were green mountains; at the end of
the bay ahead, palm trees of all kinds were clustered.
We saw a number of white houses, with low white
roofs; and, further back on the mountains, one considerably
larger house, where the French Resident
lived. Our deck was covered with a sweet-smelling
pollen, which had settled aboard during the small hours
of the morning. Near us was a small, old-fashioned
bark—Norwegian, we found out afterward—with
painted imitation square port holes, such as are seen
on old galleons. Her hull was down in the water,
showing her to be loaded, or nearly so. We were surprised
to see this vessel, for we had expected to have
the bay to ourselves. From a distance, several big, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>p159</span>
brown, grinning men inspected the <i>Snark</i>; and when
we invited them aboard, they climbed over the rail,
bringing bunches of bananas, oranges, papaias, and
various other fruits, all of which they gave us. I
lowered the launch and soon had it running, but it was
nearly noon before we had a chance to go ashore. The
natives were constantly swarming around us, all talking
at once and trying to talk to us. The big, good-natured
fellows were doing their best to make us feel
at home. With each presentation of fruit, a speech
was delivered, which always ended in a grin and a
handshake. We had learned enough of the Hawaiian
tongue to understand a little of what they said, for the
languages are very similar; and we could gather that
each one was wanting the pleasure of being our guide.</p>

<p>These people were the most hospitable and kindly
of any in the South Seas; they entertained us lavishly;
expense was no object to them; and our money was of
no value to us, as here no such medium of exchange
was in use. These people gladly prepared the most
gorgeous entertainments when they found that we were
bent on a mission of friendly inquiry and honest research
into their customs and manners.</p>

<p>At last Jack made them understand that we were
not needing assistance, but would gladly avail ourselves
of their hospitality when we got ashore. Finally,
we did go ashore, but only to stagger and roll so
that walking was almost impossible. In those sixty-one
days at sea, we had practically forgotten what <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>p160</span>
walking was. The whole village of nearly naked islanders
was awaiting us on the beach. How those
kind people did bustle good-naturedly around us!
With the whole crowd following, we made our way to
the only trading station on the island, "The Societé
Commercial de la Oceanie," a branch of the biggest
trading concern in the South Sea islands.</p>

<p>We were quickly relieved of our escort when the
two white men of the place came out and said a few
words in the native tongue. All the people stopped
out in front while we went inside. Mr. Kriech and
Mr. Rawling, two Germans, were the agents for the
company here, and during our stay they did all in their
power to show us the interesting spots on the island.
Everywhere we were stared at by the natives. Mrs.
London attracted more attention than did we men.
Few white women had ever been seen here before.
A Mrs. Fisher had lived here thirty years, and had
boarded Robert Louis Stevenson while he was at Nuka-hiva.</p>

<p>The storekeeper accompanied us to the French Resident's,
where he acted as interpreter. The French
Resident spoke no English. He was a queer, fat little
man, with a good-natured face. When we first saw
him, he was wearing overalls, and had no coat; on his
feet were wooden shoes, and on his head a military
hat. Upon observing us, he quickly donned a faded
old uniform coat, and was all dignity at once. He
did not even look at our papers, for he declared that <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>p161</span>
the word of so important a man as Monsieur London
was better than any credentials we could display. He
made us highly welcome, and did not even charge us
the usual twenty-franc hunting license.</p>

<p>Shortly after, Captain Luvins of the bark <i>Lucine</i>
came in, and to him Jack broached the subject that had
brought us to the island. We wanted to see Typee
Valley. Arrangements were immediately made for us
to go over to this famous valley, which for years and
years, in fact, since he was a little boy and had read
Herman Melville's "Typee," Jack had longed to visit.
Mr. Kriech secured horses and guides for us, and we
started next morning before sun-up.</p>

<p>When I think of those early mornings in the Marquesas,
I seem to smell anew the sweet flowers and the
copra. The soft still morning air leaves something in
one's nostrils that makes one want to go back again. I
believe that all four of the white people on the <i>Snark</i>
will drop anchor in this bay again. I know I will .&#160;.&#160;.
sometime.</p>

<p>We started early next morning, Captain Y——,
Mr. and Mrs. London, myself, a native guide, Captain
Luvins, and two girls we did not know were going,
and to whom Jack did not take very kindly at first,
until it was explained that they were the daughters of
the chief of the Typee tribe, and that their going assured
us a welcome in their valley. We were each
mounted on a small Marquesan pony, with provisions
for four days in our saddle-bags. We started off a <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>p162</span>
narrow path and headed straight for the mountains.
We climbed for hours, often going around the corner
of a mountain on a little path, where we could look
hundreds and hundreds of feet down a sheer precipice.
The little ponies were as sure-footed as goats, and
finally, at nearly noon, we reached the summit of the
mountain, the mountain that divided off the different
tribes. Looking down one side, we could see Hapaa
Valley. Back of us lay Taiohae Bay, with the Norwegian
bark and the <i>Snark</i> lying at anchor. Straight
ahead spread Typee, the wonderful valley Herman
Melville so vividly described as a paradise. We had
fought the elements and suffered for sixty-one days in
order to win to this place, and see whether it was really
the perfect spot that Melville described it, or whether,
like certain who write about our Pacific coast states,
he was but a delightful romancer. But we found that
Melville had told the truth—that if he had not told
the whole truth, it was because he had not described all
the beauties of this bewitching valley of leisure and
abundance, so far from the United States, where white
men toil and grind incessantly.</p>

<p>We rode until late in the afternoon through the
groves of bananas, thousands of big yellow bunches
that would never be picked. Our horses stumbled
over cocoanuts in the path. At one place, one of the
native girls pointed out to us what she called a shortcut.
We followed her directions, and rode right
through a cluster of hornets' nests. The girl, who remained <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>p163</span>
at a safe distance, stood and watched us fighting
the hornets and being royally stung, and laughed
heartily at what she considered the cleverness of her
practical joke. Just how much intrinsic humour there
may have been in the situation I am unable to say—being
so closely involved in it—but I am sure that the
girl was the only one who did much laughing. The
rest of us were busy swatting hornets, as were also our
horses busy in dodging.</p>

<p>Finally, we came to a clearing where the old village
of Typee had once stood. But now only the foundations
of the buildings of this once strong tribe remained
to show where they had been. The cocoanut trees we
found growing in the fantastic arrangement that Melville
had spoken of, but the natives were gone. Everything
was quiet except the chirping of the birds, and
the rustling of palm-leaves. We rode on until we
came to a frame house that had been built by a trader,
but he had left, and now a family of natives lived in
this old house on the edge of Faiaways Lake. How
delightful this little lake looked, with the background
of mountains, but how sad this one family! When
we came to them and asked for a drink of water, the
woman brought a large gourd full to the brim, and as
she extended it, we saw upon her flesh the curse of the
islands, leprosy. The man came out, dragging a big
heavy foot behind him. He had elephantiasis, and
the children that played in the yard showed signs of
leprosy.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>p164</span></p>

<p>Perhaps we should have gone back without seeing any
more of the Typee tribe, had not the girls urged us on.
We shortly came to another clearing—the new village
of the valley. Here we found about twenty grass
houses and perhaps fifty or seventy-five people, all that
remained of the once strongest tribe in the Marquesas
Islands.</p>

<p>About thirty years ago, there were six thousand natives
in this valley, with nearly as many in the opposite
valley of Hapaa. But the two tribes were continually
at war, until the Hapaa tribe was totally exterminated.
Then came ships in search of sandalwood and copra,
and came also missionaries. With them they managed
to bring leprosy and elephantiasis, and a venereal disease
that, in the tropics, is worse than either of the
others. As a result, the native hosts are gone, and
only the few remain. Still, these people we saw looked
healthy enough, though here and there we could see
a leper lurking in the background.</p>

<p>Better had it been had the natives never seen the
missionaries. What happened in the Marquesas has
happened in many other South Sea islands, and no doubt
is happening to-day. My conscience smote me. To
think, the very pennies I had given in Sunday School
for foreign missions had contributed to the calamitous
end of the inhabitants of this beautiful garden-spot!</p>

<p>After the girls had told who we were and what we
wanted, a large house was put at our disposal, and the
women brought mats for us to sit on, while the men <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>p165</span>
started a big fire and roasted several pigs. Others
brought fish and <i>poi</i> and eggs and chicken. The feast
was spread out on the ruins of an old stone house, and
we sat down to eat. Only we white people and the
two chief's daughters and the chiefs were together.
The other natives would come up respectfully and
gather their portion, then withdraw to a little distance
and eat. Of all the various kinds of edibles I have
tried in different places of this world, I think none
could compare with this. The fish was served raw,
but it was good. The <i>poi</i> had been buried in the
ground until it was slightly fermented. The natives
climbed the big cocoanut trees and picked the young
nuts for us to drink; and when we had finished eating,
they got out their queer musical instruments made of
logs, part of the natives danced and others sang, and
I lay on my mat when I had finished eating and watched
these happy people until it got too dark to see. I could
not help thinking of my friends at home, who were
bundled in heavy clothes, trying to keep warm, and
going to moving-picture shows and dances, and persuading
themselves that they were really having a
pleasant time. What a contrast between their lot
and mine!</p>

<p>That night Jack and Mrs. London slept inside on
sleeping-mats thrown on the floor, while the rest of
us slept outside on mats thrown on the ground. No
mosquitoes or insects bothered us. There were no
reptiles for us to be afraid of. The soft-treading <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>p166</span>
natives came and went all night long. Bright and early
next morning, we were awakened by the natives' getting
breakfast. When the meal was over, we went
swimming in Faiaways Lake, and that day we explored
the valley, and tried to buy curios. But they would
not sell to us. They forced us to take presents of
tapa cloth and ornaments of sharks' and porpoises'
teeth, and corals, while we made presents to them out
of our stores of tinned provisions.</p>

<p>One thing that I tried hard to bring out in photographs
was the gorgeous tattooing of the natives, but
their skins and the tattooing colour being so near the
same shade and hue, the camera cannot catch so subtle a
distinction. I tried many exposures, without success.</p>

<p>After the boys are old enough to stand the pain
of tattooing, they are started on, and it sometimes
takes years to complete them. When they are completed,
their eyelids, nose, every part of the body, are
covered with fantastic designs. Tattooing seems to
be the only really serious thought of these people, except
worshipping their big stone idols, several of which
we saw in the valley.</p>

<p>One of the girls who had come with us was named
Antoinette. She was the last left of royal blood on
Nuka-hiva, and she owned nearly all of Typee Valley
and most of Hapaa Valley, but she received little
revenue. There is much copra, but no one to gather
it. Copra, I may explain, is the dried kernel of the
cocoanut, valued at about twenty-five cents a hundred.</p>

</div>

<p class="xpno"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>p167</p>

<p>While we were here, one woman brought in a large
piece of tapa cloth, which she sold for five dollars
Chile. Chile money is the common currency here. It
is about half the value of American money, and comes
in very handy. Of course, this tapa cloth could never
have been bought elsewhere for such a sum, but in the
Marquesas quality is not considered in setting prices—only
quantity. Natives gave us calabashes, <i>hula</i>
dresses of human hair, then more tapa, until Jack was
loaded down. I bought a fine big piece of this cloth,
which is made from the bark of cocoanut trees, pounded
into a pulp, then flattened out and dried. Once it was
used for making <i>pareus</i>, but now they wrap their dead
in it.</p>

<p>At one place, the girls told us that near the mouth
of a river nearby was a large cave, in which were
petrified bodies. It had once been an old burying
ground, they said, but now a big stone had blocked the
way. I had heard of this cave, and knew that Stevenson
had once tried to force his way in after petrified
eyes, of which the natives had told him. But my own
opinion is that cave, bodies, and petrified eyes are all
myths, although they are myths in which the natives
place belief.</p>

<p>In telling of Typee, the Garden of Eden, I want
to lay special stress on this one thing: if ever there was
a Garden of Eden, it was right here in this valley.
Nowhere else in the world is the climate so perfect,
nowhere else in the world can be found the myriads <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>p168</span>
of delicious fruits, nowhere else is there such a profusion
of wild cattle, goat, turkey, and chicken, to say
nothing of the different species of ducks, cranes, storks
and pigeons. One thing that struck me as strange
was that the thousands and thousands of pure white
doves which soared and floated over our heads showed
absolutely no fear of us. It was evident they had never
been molested.</p>

<p>Big ragged mountains rose on every side, over which
were scattered waterfalls that started high up in the
mountains and fell so far that before the water had
reached the bottom it had scattered away in mists that
floated down the valley in rainbows. Turning one's
eyes at any time up the mountains, one could see the
wild goats feeding or watching one in wonder, and see
the occasional wild cattle that swung up precarious paths
and out of sight, and the wild chickens that stalked
about in search of food. One could reach up on either
hand and pick the delicious fruit, ripe from the trees.
A climate so perfect that no words can describe it, other
than to call like unto the Garden of Eden, is here.
The natives are like big happy children. They do not
steal, gossip about one another, nor carry grudges.
Instead, they sing, dance, hunt, fish, and live together
as brothers in a life of perfect peace.</p>

<p>On my return to my own country, one provincial
(and so narrow-minded) man went so far as to tell
me that he thought the United States had the most
perfect climate in the world; that it was the most perfect <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>p169</span>
country in the world; that he couldn't see why
people should poke about looking for something better—for
his part, he would see what he could of the
States, and settle down and be satisfied. Then he
started telling me of the Road of a Thousand Wonders,
the place where there are oranges and flowers the year
round.</p>

<p>Now you who read, of you let me ask: Have you
ever seen this Road of a Thousand Wonders, this
place where the oranges and flowers blossom the year
round? What was your impression of it, if so? Did
it come up to your expectations? Were you disappointed?
And are you satisfied that in seeing it you
have seen all that is worth seeing on this whirling sphere
of ours?</p>

<p>Now, I have seen the Road of a Thousand Wonders.
And I have been in Typee, the Garden of Eden. The
very thought of comparing the two places makes me
sad for the frailty of human judgment.</p>

<p>Our stay in Typee Valley was one of the most delightful
experiences of a voyage that contained much of
the delightful. It was with a profound regret that we
left it, and with the determination that some day our
eyes should again feast upon its many beauties, and that
again we should partake of the hospitality of those
who had made us so royally welcome. Back we came
to the <i>Snark</i>, filled with pleasing memories.</p>

<p>The Marquesas Islands lie in Latitude 10°, so close
to the Equator that ordinarily the sun's rays would <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>p170</span>
have been almost unbearable, but among all the South
Sea Islands the trade winds that blow every month in
the year, coming from over the sea, keep the temperature
about the same as a fine spring day in America.</p>

<p>The <i>Snark</i> lay at anchor close in to the shore. Jack
and Mrs. London secured a small frame house, the
one that Robert Louis Stevenson had lived in while
he was in the Marquesas. And they secured board
with Mrs. Fisher, the same old woman who had cooked
for Stevenson. Many of the older natives would tell
stories of the time <i>Tusitala</i> (which was Stevenson's native
name, signifying "story-teller") had lived here.
He was a great hand to entertain, and as anyone can
see from his writings, he loved and was loved by all
the natives with whom he came in contact. The Polynesians
never had a better friend than Robert Louis
Stevenson. He has done more to give the Americans
and English a good name in the islands than has any
other man.</p>

<p>After the first day in Taiohae Bay, the <i>Snark</i> was
deserted most of the time. There was never any
danger of quitting the vessel with no one on board,
for we had left the only persons who needed watching,
back in America. Hermann was a great hunter. He
usually started off early in the morning, and returned
in the evening with birds of every variety, and he would
sometimes return with wild goat. Once he shot a wild
cow. It seemed a shame to kill the cattle, for such
a little of the meat could be used, and the rest would <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>p171</span>
spoil in a day. Jack and Mrs. London went hunting
one morning, and returned about noon with the native
boys who had accompanied them bearing fourteen
goats.</p>

<p>But the great attraction for the natives was our
graphophone. When evening fell, they came about
us in swarms to hear the playing, and they could never
get over the belief that we had a little dwarf caged
in the "talk-box." At times, there would be as many
as two hundred brown people squatting on the grass,
and they would never leave until we stopped the graphaphone.
In the Hawaiian Islands, we had secured
records of <i>hula-hula</i> music, which so delighted the Marquesans
that sometimes we would have half a hundred
dancing in front of the machine.</p>

<p>The natives who lived nearby in a small grass hut
came to the house one day with the request that we
play the graphaphone for them to dance by. Jack
left his writing, and all that afternoon while he played
these men practised different steps, and I believe a new
<i>hula-hula</i> was originated that day.</p>

<p>The men, understanding nearly half of the Hawaiian
language, sang with the graphaphone, keeping time
by clapping their hands and swaying their bodies.
They would anoint themselves from head to foot with
cocoanut oil, until their skin was shiny. The cocoanut
oil emitted a faint, pleasant odour, which, once smelled,
is never forgotten. They would dance as fast as their
limbs could carry them, the womenfolk keeping time <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>p172</span>
with their hands. Even the children imitated them.
A native Polynesian can no more keep from dancing
when he hears music than a duck can keep away from
water.</p>

<p>The house where Jack lived was tended by an old
man and a woman, who were covered with tattooing.
The man's face looked like a convict's uniform—brown
and blue instead of white and blue, with long
stripes clear across the face. The woman had a trick
of pulling up her dress and showing the tattooing on
her legs whenever she saw anyone admiring it on her
feet. Very immodest she was, but then, there is no
such thing as modesty among such people as these.
I think some staid persons I have seen in America
would be vastly shocked by the things that take place
in the Marquesas.</p>

<p>These natives are considerably larger than the average
white person. Their skin is a light brown colour;
their hair is thick, straight and black. Dark eyes and
eyelashes make them appear a fine, handsome race.
The only unfortunate thing is their tendency to age
so soon. At fifteen the girls are fully developed
women, and at twenty-eight or-nine they are old
women. They seem to have no vitality; though they
look strong and healthy, if one were told that he was
going to die, and had the idea impressed on his mind,
he would be sure to lie down and die.</p>

<p>They have no morals at all. Their marriage contracts
are so flimsy that if one wants a divorce, he needs <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>p173</span>
only to apply to the chief; and a couple can be married
and divorced in the same day. There were few white
men here, but all had native women, and were continually
changing. The girls, from fourteen years up,
make their homes with first one native and then with
another. If they want to marry a man they say so, and
if he refuses them they call him "missionary." I was
sitting on a barrel in front of the trading store one day,
when several young <i>vahines</i> (women) came up, and
tried to talk to me. One grabbed me by the arm, and
pointing to the others: "She wife—she wife—she
wife—me no wife!" One girl had a white baby
of which she was very proud. To my mind, the girls
here were better looking than the Hawaiian girls, but
they were much more lax in their notions of becoming
conduct.</p>

<p>All of Jack's photographic supplies were spoiled, so
I was kept busy printing pictures from mine. Once,
while I was engaged in this work, a girl came in the
house, without knocking, and was tickled nearly to
death watching me develop velox. After that, she came
and went whenever she wished, but always dispensed
with the formality of knocking.</p>

<p>We had aboard the <i>Snark</i> a full set of dentist's tools,
which Jack had had no chance to use up to this time.
His entire experience of dentistry had been gained by
practise on a skull he had purchased in Honolulu. He
was always wanting someone of the crew to act as
patient. Wada had once pulled a tooth with a string <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>p174</span>
before Jack could get to him, and Jack never forgave
Wada for that.</p>

<p>One day I found an old Chinaman—the only Chinaman
on the island—groaning on the beach with the
toothache. Here was Jack's chance; I rushed off and
told him. He urged me to hold the Chinaman until
Nakata went aboard for his tools. Then the Chinaman
was led to the back of the house. The poor old
fellow was shaking with fright. After Jack found,
by reading in his little dental book, the proper forceps
to use, and was ready to start on the operation, I cried
for him to wait until I got my kodak. Mrs. London
ran for hers, too. When I yelled "pull," Jack
pulled mightily, and he nearly fell over on his back,
the tooth came out so easily. But we got the photographs!</p>

<p>The most amusing thing I saw while here was the
jail. It was a little old wooden shack, so small that
it would hold only two or three persons—and not then,
if they wanted to get out. The French government
used Nuka-hiva as a penal settlement. Some twenty or
thirty prisoners were kept here, and they were the happiest
prisoners I ever saw. Why, they didn't need
to stay in jail unless they wanted to, so they had built
grass houses. One of the long-term men had married,
and not only did the government feed him, but it fed
his wife as well—better food than the natives ever
got, and it was cooked, too. They were supposed to
work, but the old jailor was as lazy as they, so I don't <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>p175</span>
think any of them ever did a stroke. Tom the Jailor
had once lived in Papeete, Tahiti, and was the proud
possessor of an old suit of clothes. These clothes
were only worn on state occasions; the rest of the time
he dressed like any other native. Tom could speak
a little of the English language, and he used to bring
all his family around to the house so he could show
off his knowledge of the white man's talk. One day
I was enquiring about a string of porpoise teeth made
in the form of a necklace that his daughter was wearing,
and Tom took it from her and gave it to me.
These porpoise teeth are very valuable and are used
by the Marquesans in lieu of money.</p>

<p>The Norwegian bark of which I spoke had been
anchored in this bay for six months. The captain
owned the vessel, so he could stay as long as he wanted
to without anyone's complaining; and I don't think his
ten sailors wanted to leave any more than he did.
They all had native girls to whom they seemed to give
more time than to the loading of copra. And I think
it probable they would have been there yet had it not
been for a queer little comedy that I saw enacted.</p>

<p>A large stone idol stood back in the mountains, that
the natives were very superstitious about. They believed
that anyone touching this image or even going
into its shrine cast a spell on them. Now the captain
of the bark did not know this, and as it was a very
fine piece of work, he decided to take it back to his
country with him. His ten sailors cut a large cocoanut <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>p176</span>
tree, and the image, which weighed two tons, was
made fast to the middle. It took two days to get it
down to the ship. During this time not a native was
to be seen, and it was not till the work was done and
the sailors tried to go back to their girls that they knew
of the superstition attached to the idol. The girls
would have nothing further to do with them; so a few
days later they set sail and started on their long journey,
first to stop at St. Helena, and then on to Norway.</p>

<p>As our launch drew too much water, we used to
borrow small native canoes with which to go out in the
bay, and were able to come and go without difficulty.
One night Hermann arrived astraddle an overturned
canoe. He had been to some kind of feast ashore,
and had mounted the wrong side of the canoe. Hermann
often did these little things.</p>

<p>Our favourite loafing-place was the German traders'
headquarters. Here the natives would bring curios
for us to buy. It was our custom to buy knives and
sticks of tobacco of the Company at white man's prices
and trade them to the natives at brown man's prices.
For instance, a knife we would buy of the trader for
twenty-five cents, we would trade to the Marquesans at
$1.00 value. Four hundred per cent. is the regular
scale of South Sea profit.</p>

<span class="caption">The Old Home of Robert Louis Stevenson,
Marquesas Islands <a class="imglst" href="#ILLUSTRATIONS">Imglst</a></span>
</div>

<p>The copra that I have mentioned is the principal
article of South Sea commerce. The natives collect
the cocoanuts after they have fallen from the tree, and
after hulling them, cut the nut in two in the centre, and <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>p177</span>
the pieces are laid in the sun until the meat is dried and
broken away from the shell. It is then ready for shipping.
Soap-oils and perfumes are made from copra.
One company that has stations in the Marquesas, the
Society, and the Taumotu Islands, collects fifty thousand
tons of copra every year.</p>

<p>The cocoanut trees grow anywhere they can find
sand to hold their roots; even places where no other
vegetation will grow the cocoanuts thrive. They
must have plenty of water—the soil makes no difference.</p>

<p>Near Mr. London's frame bungalow were numerous
mountain streams where the natives bathed. Some
of these people seemed to spend most of their time in
the water. Captain Y——, who liked bathing but
was a little bashful, used to have a hard time finding
a place where he could swim unobserved. One day,
he and I were bathing close to the house in a spot
where we thought we were safe. When we started
out, we heard a snicker ashore, and there stood two
native girls, watching us. We sank down in the water,
which just struck us to the chin. Captain Y—— told
the girls to go away, but they didn't understand, and
when he threw a shell at them, they thought it a new
game, and threw it back. Finally, we made a wild dash
for our clothes, and finished dressing back in the jungle.</p>

<p>The girls here make ornaments of land-snail shells,
several of which ornaments I now treasure among the <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>p178</span>
curios I brought back with me from the South Seas.</p>

<p>The healthy appearance of these people is due to
their method of living: sleeping in their grass houses
is nearly the same as sleeping in the open air. They
eat fruits and fish and very little meat—in fact, very
little of what they eat is cooked. They grind the
different kinds of fruit together and make <i>poi</i>. The
leaves of certain trees and grasses are made into salads.
One salad that they prepare only on state occasions
is made by taking the heart from a young cocoanut
tree; but a handful can be secured from each tree;
and as it kills the tree, there is an unwritten law that
this salad can be made only with the chief's consent.</p>

<p>Tom the Jailor was a polite old fellow, especially
polite to Mrs. London. He would bring fruit to
us nearly every morning, and would help at any work
we were doing, although, like Rip Van Winkle, he
was too lazy to do any work for himself. Once, when
Mrs. London asked him his age, he said he did not
know, although he knew he was still young, to prove
which he climbed one of the tallest cocoanut trees
nearby, and brought us the nut. The young nut, rich
with milk, could also be eaten with a spoon, and was
much better than when dried.</p>

<p>I wish it were possible for me to describe Taiohae
Bay. Photographs give no idea of its beauty. And
I know no description can do it justice. Viewed from
our ship as she lay at anchor in the harbour, it presented <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>p179</span>
the appearance of a vast natural amphitheatre
overgrown with vines. The deep glens that furrowed
its sides seemed like enormous fissures graven by the
disruptive influences of time. Very often, when lost
in admiration of its beauty, I have experienced a pang
of regret that a scene so enchanting should be hidden
from the world in these remote seas, and seldom meet
the eyes of devoted lovers of nature.</p>

<p>Besides this bay, the shores of the island are indented
by several other extensive inlets, into which
descend broad and fertile valleys. These are inhabited
by several distinct tribes of islanders, who, although
speaking kindred dialects of the same tongue,
have from time immemorial waged hereditary warfare
against each other. The intervening mountains,
generally two or three thousand feet above the sea-level,
define the territories of each of the three tribes.</p>

<p>The bay of Nuka-hiva, in which we were lying, is
an expanse of water not unlike in figure the space included
within the limits of a horse-shoe, being perhaps
nine miles in circumference. From the verge of the
water, the land rises uniformly on all sides, with
green and sloping elevations and swells that rise into
lofty heights. Down each of these valleys flows a
clear stream, here and there assuming the form of
slender cascades, then stealing along invisibly until it
bursts upon the sight again in large and more noisy
waterfalls, and at last demurely wanders along to the
sea.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />
THE SOCIETY ISLANDS</h2>
<p class="toclink"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></p>
<p>One thousand miles to the west of the Marquesas
Islands lie the Society Islands. Both groups are of
volcanic origin. Stretching between them are the low
coral reefs of the Paumota Archipelago. In order to
get to the Society group, it was necessary for us to go
through the thick of these low reefs.</p>

<p>Robert Louis Stevenson was lost for nearly two
weeks among these lagoons; whaling and trading ships
avoid them; and navigators have given them the name
Dangerous Archipelago.</p>

<p>We had been in the Marquesas Islands a little over
two weeks when Jack decided that we had better be
getting on. So word was sent out to the natives that
on a certain day we would want fruit and fowl; and
on that day, canoes were coming and going from daybreak
to twilight, and by evening our decks were littered
with good things of every shape and colour;
the life-boat had been filled with oranges; sacks containing
pineapples, yams, and taro were piled on the
deck; the cockpit was so full of green cocoanuts that
there was barely room left for us to steer; and there
were bananas of every stage of ripeness, from very
green to very ripe, hung upside down to the davits.</p>

<p>We had expected to start away on December 17, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>p181</span>
but we did not do so, for late in the afternoon a white
spot showed on the horizon at the mouth of the bay
and gradually got brighter until the schooner <i>Tameraihoe
Tahiti</i> dropped anchor close to us. Here was
news, and we could not leave until we knew what was
going on in the world. The schooner had met the
steamer in Papeete, Tahiti, two months before, and
had some three-months-old San Francisco papers
aboard.</p>

<p>There were three white men on this ship. One was
such an interesting subject that I must tell of him. He
had come years before, when only a young man. He
was in the employ of some trading concern that he
still worked for, and on his rounds among the islands
he had met and fallen in love with a native girl, but
she only laughed at him, saying that he was not nearly
so good-looking as the natives, because not tattooed.
Now, the girl's brother was just learning this art, and
as he thought the white man's skin would be fine for
practise, he persuaded the trader to be tattooed. The
man quit the company, and for six months lived in a
native house in the mountains while the boy practised
tattooing on him every day, until the work was done
and the skin healed up. Then he made his way to
the girl's home. At first the girl was frightened;
then she nearly went into hysterics, and ridiculed him;
and finally, she insulted him in the worst possible
manner—she spat upon him, and ran away into the
jungle. And the tattooed white man never saw her <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>p182</span>
again. Now he is one of the wealthiest men in Polynesia;
pearl shell, copra, and sandalwood have reaped
him a fortune that is of no use to him, for he can
never return to civilised people again.</p>

<p>On December 18 we left Taiohae Bay, at seven-thirty
in the evening. We started thus late because
we had to wait for a land-breeze to spring up before
we could set sail. The trading vessel gave us three
salutes with their cannon as we started. Owing to
the lightness of the breeze, we were an hour getting
out. All the time the vessel was giving us three
salutes, while Hermann kept the shotgun hot answering.
As long as I live, I shall never forget that clearing.
The full moon was just rising over the mountains,
making it almost as light as day. We caught
the trades just out of the mouth, and soon were flying
southeast at six knots. No one was seasick; it seemed
almost as if we had not been ashore at all, but were
still on the long traverse from Hilo.</p>

<p>The days were very hot. We accordingly changed
our working hours, getting up early and laying off
during the extreme heat. I say "working hours,"
but the truth is that extremely little work was done
at all. Jack wrote as usual, Mrs. London did her
typing, and all took their tricks at the wheel, but most
of the time we just lay around on deck and read or
chatted.</p>

<p>For the first two days or so we skirted the shores
of numerous small islands of the Marquesan group, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>p183</span>
but we soon left them behind. On the fourth day
out, squalls began to blow up every few minutes, looking
like storms as they came up over the horizon, but
always fizzling away in a little rain. That evening
the wind suddenly shifted from east to west, sending
the sails across deck with a boom, almost enough to tear
the masts out. As it was, it carried away a stanchion
on the rail, and the boom tackle.</p>

<p>Everybody's nerves were on end, what of the nasty
and uncertain weather. According to the chart, we
had a coral reef about fifteen miles on either side of
us, making this a bad place in which to encounter a
storm. Early on the morning of the 24th, we sighted
cocoanut palms on our port side, but no land at all,
only the tall palms above the horizon. We left them
behind, and soon picked up another island, but could
see only the palms as before, though more of them.
The barometer had been falling for thirty-six hours,
and numerous quick squalls swept over us. All hands
were kept on deck all of Christmas Eve and all of
Christmas Day. No one seemed to realise that it was
Christmas, for the heat and squalls and barometer
together had greatly worried us. This was the middle
of the typhoon season, and we were in the most dangerous
part of the world for storms.</p>

<p>The day after Christmas we sighted the tall cocoanut
palms growing on the first of the Taumotu Islands;
then for two days longer we could see the tops of the
palm trees on every side, but during this time we <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>p184</span>
could catch no glimpse of land, as the islands rise only
between two and six feet above the water, and cannot
be seen over five or six miles away.</p>

<p>Jack had decided that our first stop in the Taumotus
would be on one of the largest of the atolls, known
as Rangiroa. Early on the fifth morning we sighted
what we supposed to be this atoll. We had not been
able to make observations since leaving the Marquesas,
for the sky had been overcast with low, black, threatening
clouds, so we were navigating by dead reckoning
only; and as the currents and tides are known to
be very treacherous, it was merely blind guess-work
instead of real navigating.</p>

<span class="caption">The Price of a Wife, feather money
 <a class="imglst" href="#ILLUSTRATIONS">Imglst</a></span>
</div>

<p>All morning and most of the afternoon we coasted
along about a mile from a low coral reef, on which
the surf thundered and pounded. The strip of land
was only about a quarter of a mile wide, but one hundred
miles in circumference, forming an atoll with a
large lagoon in the centre. We sailed within a mile
of the low sandy beach before we could make out an
opening, and Captain Y—— finally decided that this
was not the lagoon we were looking for, but that the
one ahead was, so we sailed up the coast of this island,
so close that we could plainly make out the remains
of a schooner that had been wrecked upon the reef.
Perhaps this old hull was the monument of human
lives, the last relict of those who had sailed her.
This did not prove to be the atoll we were looking for,
nor did the next, or the next; we were getting among <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>p185</span>
islands so thick that it was necessary to carry double
watches at night on deck. Captain Y—— acted like
a man driven crazy, for the ship was in his care, and
the currents and squalls were so deceptive during this
time that he was almost entirely deprived of sleep.
One day we had sighted several small sails to the leeward
of us; on trying to get to them we found our
way blocked by a reef just on a level with the water,
so low that had it been night nothing could have saved
us from being wrecked. While we were trying to
get round the reef, the sails disappeared beneath the
sky-line, and we were still in a dangerous position.
Little islands scarcely large enough to bear one cocoanut
tree would spring up ahead, and then we must
spend valuable time beating around them. It was not
the island itself that we were most afraid of, it was
the reef that we knew always surrounded the island,
sometimes over a mile from the land.</p>

<p>Large merchant ships have spent weeks and weeks
trying to get out of this group. Little pearling luggers
pile up on the white coral by the hundreds, every
year. Something like two thousand of these small
pearling vessels are scattered through these islands.
Pearl shell is the only article of value to be found.
Every season, scores of lives are lost in the hurricanes
that sweep over the islands; the sand, being so close
to the water, will often be levelled off to the water-line.
The only safe place during such storms is on
some sort of boat in the centre of the lagoon.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>p186</span></p>

<p>The atolls are all about the same shape—that is,
circular. The land, about a quarter of a mile in width,
will sometimes form in such a large circle that it will
be impossible to see across the lagoon. However,
we could see the whole of the atoll of the ones we
sailed past.</p>

<p>We had been tangled up among these islands for
seven days. There was no sun, no stars, from which
to work our observations. We had now given up all
thought of anchoring anywhere in the Archipelago—if
we could only get away, far away, we would be more
than satisfied. Even had we wanted to anchor, it
seemed impossible, for the openings made by the run
of the tide as it ebbed and flowed were too small for
us to enter, and the reefs around the outside of the
atolls were too rough for us to give a thought to.
We knew that if we worked to the south, we would
eventually get out. Had the islands been properly
charted we could easily have located our position, but
as it was, all was confusion and guess-work. In this
duty, as in most others, the French had been very remiss.
It was too late in the season for many pearling
boats, and very few traders ever attempted these
passages, although I afterward saw in Papeete several
old Kanaka captains who had worked through
these lagoons as the Indians used to locate themselves
in America—more by instinct than through any practical
knowledge.</p>

<p>It was on the seventh day out that we saw clear <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>p187</span>
water ahead. That night we sailed out of the reach
of any cross-currents, and we now had clear water
ahead to Papeete. All sail was crowded on, for the
barometer was still acting queerly, and we did not
relish the idea of being caught in a hurricane in so
small a vessel. During this trip, we had not tasted
one bit of meat. The fruit of every variety, and the
yams and taro, made food that, for health, in the
tropics has no equal.</p>

<p>Nakata was the biggest banana-eater I ever saw.
He would keep his Japanese stomach filled with bananas
all the time. Once he made a bet with Jack
that he could eat twenty bananas in half an hour.
He managed to eat a dozen with no difficulty, but after
that he had to force them down, and he got stalled
on his eighteenth banana. He just could not force
down another one. One night, while it was his watch
on deck, he got hold of a tin of salmon which gave
him ptomaine poisoning. He was doubled up on deck
for several hours while I poured mustard down him,
but next day he was all right again.</p>

<p>On the morning of the ninth day we sighted the
island of Tahiti, and raised a signal for a pilot. A
Frenchman came out in a large whale-boat, manned
by twelve big Tahitians. The wind was light, so
that we did not get inside Papeete Bay until nearly
noon. Papeete Bay is more like a lagoon with a
narrow passage, than it is like a bay. About one
mile across, the water is so deep close to the shore <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>p188</span>
that a ship can make fast to a cocoanut tree on the
beach.</p>

<p>We had been expected in Papeete for a couple of
months. Sailing authorities had given us up as lost.</p>

<p>I shall never forget that scene as we tacked back
and forth against a light headwind; hundreds of little
pearling luggers tied to the shore all around the bay,
a French man-of-war tied up to a small wharf; an
American warship anchored in the centre of the bay;
and back on the gradual slopes of the mountains the
city of Papeete, the capital of the South Seas, a city
so gay that I can only compare it by calling it the
Paris of the South Sea islands.</p>

<p>The American warship saluted us as we passed
under her stern, and a couple of hundred American
sailors set up a cheer that was worth all the hardships
we had been through to hear. And to see the
old Stars and Stripes again! Surrounded by flags of
other nationalities, our old flag looked better than
ever before; and no words can describe our feelings
as those white-clad jackies cheered the crew of the
<i>Snark</i>. We wanted to show our appreciation of their
welcome, but the best we could do was to bare our
heads as the big flag on the stern of the warship was
raised and lowered three times.</p>

<p>Then as we passed the warship, a little canoe with
two passengers bore down on us. One of the passengers
was a big, sunburned white man, with long hair
and beard, dressed only in a native loin-cloth. He <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>p189</span>
urged along the native who was paddling the canoe,
while he stood upright waving a big red flag. When
he got close enough to be understood, he yelled:
"Hello, Jack," and Jack, recognising him, answered:
"Hello, Darling." Then the Nature Man, as Darling
is called, came alongside. We could not let him
aboard, for the doctor had not passed us yet, but that
did not hinder his piling baskets of fruit on our deck,
and jars of honey, and jams, and jells, of his own
make. He was so glad to see us that he cried; and
as I leaned over to shake hands with him, it seemed
that I had clasped the hand of a friend, and so it
proved. Ernest Darling, the Nature Man, was one
of the best friends I ever made in the South Sea
islands. I came to know him well during our stay at
Papeete, Tahiti.</p>

<p>The Society group comprises about twenty-five small
islands, the greatest of which is called Tahiti. On
the windward side of Tahiti is located the city of
Papeete, the largest settlement in Polynesia.</p>

<p>Papeete has a population of five thousand. About
one thousand of the population are French; five hundred
are Chinamen, and the remainder are natives,
with a sprinkling of New Zealanders, Australians,
Germans and Americans. The city lies at the foot of
a large mountain, and is fed by the finest supply of
fresh, cool water of any city in the tropics. This
water, coming from the high mountains, rushes down
past Papeete as cool and clear and pure as spring <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>p190</span>
water. At the outside of Papeete are large cocoanut
groves and sugar-cane plantations. In the city are
several first-class business buildings, and the French
have built splendid bungalows; but inside the town
the natives live in their grass houses, and always will,
I suppose, for a frame building is too close and confining
for them—they will invariably select a grass
house in preference to a frame. These islands belong
to the French, than whom there are no people in the
world with better ideas on making clean, pretty cities.
As a consequence, they have in Papeete well-kept,
parked streets, and cultivated lawns.</p>

<p>The tropical ferns and trees are excellent for decorating,
as the trees are easily trained to any shape,
and they use the rare figures to advantage. The
traveller's palm is one of the rarest of the palm
species, and is used quite extensively in decorating the
government grounds.</p>

<p>The French government in the South Seas is as
funny as a comic opera. In their love of pomp and
display, the officials parade the streets in blue and
gold uniforms, with medals pinned to their coats.
The man-o'-war <i>Zelle</i> is stationed here to keep down
rebellions, but even to think of these quiet people's
rebelling is amusing.</p>

<p>The <i>Zelle</i> makes regular trips among the other
islands, and the first class battleship <i>Catinet</i> makes
one trip a year to Papeete from France. Each ship
carries something like two hundred men, who just <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>p191</span>
about turn Papeete upside down when they get ashore.
It seemed to me that the officers had very little control
over the men, for they came and went from the
ship whenever they felt like it, and the ships, as
compared with the American warship <i>Annapolis</i>, were
about the dirtiest, most ill-kept fighting vessels I ever
saw. I have heard the French sailors talk back to
the officers when they had been ordered aboard the
ship; and one sailor told an officer to go to h—,
that he intended to stay ashore all night. Should an
American sailor ever return so much as one word to
an officer, he would most likely be court-martialled.</p>

<p>About one hundred sailors were busy one day beaching
a large coal-barge near the <i>Snark</i>, with six or
eight officers overseeing the work. I stood on the
rail of the <i>Annapolis</i> with several American jackies,
watching the operation. The sailors were all talking
at once, so loud that the officers could not be heard,
and finally the officers gave up in disgust and let the
men do the work to suit themselves.</p>

<p>But to me most interesting were the tiny trading
schooners that ply between here and the hundreds of
small islands within a radius of a thousand miles—dozens
of them, some of such meagre proportions that
a man can hardly stand between the rail and the tiny
poop deck over the little hold. Yet, I have seen fifteen
almost naked islanders squatted on the deck and
poop, with no room to lie down, in which position
they would probably remain until they got to their <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>p192</span>
destination, some minor coral island in the low Archipelago.
It was always amusing to watch one of
these vessels unload, for the cargo was sure to be
queer.</p>

<p>One schooner I noticed had several bags of copra,
several of pearl shell, four live turtles weighing about
three hundred and fifty pounds—the largest I ever
saw—and the rigging was hanging full of bananas.
In addition, there were ten native men and women
aboard. I wondered how they could make expenses,
for the whole thing would not bring over twenty-five
dollars. The turtles they sold for two dollars each,
and the bananas at ten cents a bunch.</p>

<p>I think Papeete might easily be called the city of
girls, for they outnumber the male population two
to one. From the Taumotu and Marquesas Islands
and the rest of the Society Islands, the girls come to
Papeete when about fifteen years old to complete their
education, which consists of playing the accordion and
dancing the <i>hula-hula</i>. Playing an accordion is as
much of an accomplishment with these girls as playing
the piano is with an American girl. Every evening,
from every direction, will be heard music and
singing, and one will see crowds of girls, hand in
hand, singing and dancing through all the streets.
From eight o'clock in the evening until nearly midnight
this merry-making goes on, like a continual carnival,
every night. On account of the extreme minority
of the men, the streets seem to be flooded with <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>p193</span>
nothing but girls. They wear a loose white wrapper
in the evenings, called an <i>au-au</i>. In the daytime they
wear gaudy coloured <i>au-aus</i>. The French government
compels the girls to wear these dresses inside the city
limits, but outside they wear only the comfortable
<i>pareus</i>.</p>

<p>After the first day we had anchored the <i>Snark</i> in
Papeete Harbor, we secured Darling, the Nature
Man, to stay aboard; and while Mr. and Mrs. London
rented a small house, Captain Y—— and I rented
a small two-roomed bungalow, while Wada and Nakata
found accommodation elsewhere in the town.
Hermann went on a protracted drunk, which lasted
so long that Jack gave him his walking papers. He
afterward secured the job of second mate on a small
trading vessel.</p>

<p>We had been in Papeete but a few days when the
steamer <i>Mariposa</i> made port from San Francisco, and
we learned the first of the panic in the United States.
Jack's business affairs were badly tangled, so it became
necessary for him to go back to attend to them,
leaving the rest of the crew in Papeete. No one
was sorry that we were delayed, for we had just
about decided that we should like to live here.</p>

<p>An interesting place was the market. Life in
Papeete starts at five o'clock, when the market opens.
Fish, fruit and vegetables are brought before sunrise,
and at five o'clock sharp the people may begin buying.
Two known lepers have their booths in this market, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>p194</span>
where they sell fruit that the Kanakas buy just as
readily as from any other fruit vendors. For several
hours the market square is crowded with buyers and
with girls anxious to show their finery. It seems
queer, but this is the time to show their clothes, for
half the town is there to see them. The market is the
most important place in Papeete. Even during the
hottest part of the day, sleepy Kanakas will be on
guard over the fruit until later in the afternoon, when
the people come out again; and for the rest of the day
until midnight the crowds loaf around here making
small purchases of fruit, which is eaten on the spot.</p>

<p>Just imagine buying one of these big yellow bunches
of bananas for what would equal ten cents of our
money, and as many oranges as one could carry for
five cents! But the best fruit, alone worth a trip to
Tahiti, is the big red juicy mangoes, and another
banana, the <i>fei</i>, which, when cooked, makes a substitute
for the best pudding ever tasted.</p>

<p>I had secured the services of three French blacksmiths,
who called themselves machinists, to help me
on the engines. We took all the machinery from the
engine-room, and completely overhauled it. Also,
we installed new rigging on deck, swung our boats on
their davits, and repainted the <i>Snark</i>, inside and out.</p>

<p>Our bungalow was just a block up the beach from
the <i>Snark</i>, on a quiet, shady street where the élite of
the city lived. As no one worked during the middle
of the day, Captain Y—— and I stayed at home in <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>p195</span>
our cool bungalow, eating fruit and reading, until late
in the afternoon. We had always a bottle of cognac
or absinthe, and plenty of tobacco, of which the natives
who visited us partook freely. At our house, we saw
the real <i>hula-hulas</i>, and heard native music and singing
that tourists who happen to come to Papeete never encounter.
Everyone smokes in the South Seas—girls,
children, men and women—and all drink. The
Kanakas would have drunk our cognac and absinthe
like beer, had we allowed it. In the daytime, the
girls came and squatted on our floor, making shell
wreaths or weaving hats. Their toilet is very simple.
On arising, they take a bath, slip on a <i>pareu</i>, over that
an <i>au-au</i>, put on a wreath of flowers, wash their hair
in cocoanut oil, tuck a flower under the right ear, and—the
toilet is complete. They have a saying that
only white people and fools wear shoes, so of course
they go barefoot.</p>

<p>The girls gave a big <i>hula-hula</i> one day just back
of our bungalow, in a big grass house built for the
occasion. In the morning they got a large demijohn
of orange beer from the mountains, and by evening
were pretty drunk, but that did not prevent eighteen
girls from giving the prettiest dance I ever saw, while
four others played their weird music on tom-tom
drums. One old woman kept shouting and jumping
throughout the dance. At times they would shout in
chorus, and all squat on the floor together, holding
their hands over their heads and keeping time by <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>p196</span>
rhythmical waving. Again, they would give short hops
and yells, holding on to each other and keeping time
by a peculiar scraping of their bare feet.</p>

<p>In the cool of the afternoon, I would start again on
the engines, and work until dark, while Captain Y——,
in his new white clothes, would promenade around
Papeete, telling everyone that he was captain of the
<i>Snark</i>. Captain Y—— was really a pretty good fellow,
but he took himself too seriously. He was well
liked by everyone who knew him. He was known
throughout the Society Islands in a short time. In
fact, it was impossible to see him without getting acquainted,
for he <em>would</em> have everybody know that
Captain Y—— of the <i>Snark</i> was in town; and as
he was a pretty good spender and a sociable club fellow,
the people were always glad to have him about.
The two clubs extended to him and Jack and me honorary
membership cards to their club houses. One,
the "Circle Bouganville," gave dances and held social
sessions, which we usually attended. We were always
sure of a good time, though it got very tiresome saluting
the many captains we found there. These "captains"
strutted about the streets like peacocks, and
gathered in the evening at the "Circle Bouganville" to
drink until morning. There was always plenty of
them! It was safe to call any man captain, for even
if he did not hold the title, he would be so flattered
that he would take special pains to speak to you at
every meeting.</p>

<p class="xpno"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>p197</p>

<p>On the government grounds is a large bandstand.
Here the band, pride of Papeete, plays several times
a week. The band is small, very small, only a little
larger than a tiny orchestra, and the music is horrible,
but it supplies an excuse for the population to gather
for a good time. Usually, a few <i>hula-hula</i> dancers
have more attention than the band.</p>

<p>These people are great hands to bedeck themselves
with flowers. The older people carry on a very profitable
business during the evenings, selling wreaths.
The Tahitians would no more think of going out in
the evening without wearing flowers than the average
man in the States would think of going without his
shirt.</p>

<p>The Kanakas (the name holds even outside Hawaii)
are very religious during church hours; the rest of
the time they forget about it. The big Catholic church
is the finest building in the town, being made entirely
of coral cement. The other buildings are of
wood.</p>

<p>Along the water-front the principal street, known
as Broom Road, runs clear around the bay in the
shape of a horse-shoe. One side of the street is
lined with buildings. On the other side is the beach.
At one end of the beach is a shipbuilding yard, where
small pearling luggers are built and repaired. The
rise and fall of the tide in this bay is so great that no
dry dock is necessary. Some of the vessels have names
almost as large as the ship. For instance, there is <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>p198</span>
the <i>Teheipouroura Tapuai</i>, a mission schooner belonging
to the Catholics.</p>

<p>The streets running into the market square are lined
with Chinese stores, and the headquarters of the several
trading concerns that send schooners among the
other islands. The Chinese are the only ones that
can carry on a retail business. The Kanakas are too
lazy, and the white people could not live on so small
a scale. About all the natives need is coloured calico,
fruits, cheap overalls, and singlets. They make their
own hats when they wear any, and a white coat is the
only thing the French ever buy in the way of luxuries.</p>

<p>Now that I am back in America, I can appreciate
their quiet lazy life better than I could then. To
be able to sit or sleep under those big shady trees or
to take a book out there to read, all the time with
plenty of fruit handy, and with nothing to worry over,
is a genuine luxury.</p>

<p>Now and then a sailing vessel will drop in from
America or Europe or Australia, loaded with lumber,
and ships of wine come from France. Every six weeks
arrive the <i>Mariposa</i> from San Francisco and the <i>Manapaoura</i>
from New Zealand, while warships of every
nation coal here on their long journeys across the
Pacific. It is only when the South American warships
put into port that any real trouble begins, for the
South American jackies always have fights with the
French jackies. The Americans licked a few of the <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>p199</span>
Frenchmen while I was at Papeete, and after that
there was peace for a while.</p>

<p>Papeete is the centre of the pearling industry of the
South Seas. Hundreds of little sloops lie here during
the hurricane season, while the captains strut about the
streets. None of the captains can navigate. They
sail entirely from dead reckoning, often taking weeks
to go a few hundred miles, when a captain who could
navigate would take only as many days. But they
put no value on time. They simply look for an island
until they find it. Every year, when it is time for
the pearling vessels to come in from the Taumotus,
there are always many missing which are never heard
from again.</p>

<p>The pearl shell is loaded in large sailing vessels.
Most of it is sent to Europe. The pearl divers are
only after the shell, and not after the real pearl, as
most persons think. If they are lucky enough to find
a pearl, they are that much ahead, but fishing for the
pearl alone would be a very unprofitable business.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX<br />
SOME SOUTH SEA ROYALTY</h2>
<p class="toclink"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></p>
<p>The islands that we are familiar with as the South
Sea Islands are properly called Oceania. Oceania is
divided off in four distinct parts, known as Polynesia,
or the eastern islands; Australasia, or the southern
islands, including Australia; Melanesia, the islands
lying to the north and west of Australia; and Micronesia,
which lies to the north and west of Melanesia.
The characteristics, the languages, and the customs
of the people of each distinct division have no
similarity.</p>

<p>The Polynesian people are supposed to be descended
in mixed line from the Spanish and original
Tahitians. It is certain that they have a strain of
white blood in their makeup, for they have none of
the negroid characteristics found farther west. They
are a quiet, easy-going people, whom it would be hard
to disturb. Their colour is a light reddish-brown,
and they have black eyes and hair and well-rounded,
intelligent faces. Very seldom is one of these people
angry. It must be something out of the ordinary to
arouse their anger, but when once aroused, they lose
their heads entirely, they make no discrimination between
friends and foes, and they are best given a wide
berth until their fit of temper has passed.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>p201</span></p>

<p>Among the inhabitants of any community, will always
be found some characters of sufficient strength
and uniqueness to distinguish them from the herd.
In the South Seas, they are usually chiefs, or old retired
sea-captains and beach-combers, who hold this
position in the Australasian, Melanesian and Micronesian
sections, but in the Polynesian section the place
of honour unquestionably belongs to Helene of Raiatea.
Hers was the greatest power, though it was not a
vested one. She seemed a true South Sea queen.</p>

<p>Raiatea is another island of the Society group, and
Helene's home. She was the most prominent personage
in these islands, and a typical Polynesian. I
had ample opportunity to study her—her every mood
and whim. Helene of Raiatea was known to all successful
traders, and we were advised to be pleasant
to her, as the success or failure of many a trader has
depended on the smiles or frowns of Helene of
Raiatea. It is needless to say that we took the advice,
and invited Helene to be guest on board the <i>Snark</i>.
Helene had no royal blood, nor was she of chieftain
stock, but many a chief or king had less power than
she.</p>

<p>She had been born with more energy than the average
Kanaka, and a constant mingling with the white
people had given her ideas above her class. A little
over the average height, her figure was admirable.
Her skin was a light olive colour; she had two perfect
rows of teeth and a brain that seemed never to be still.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>p202</span></p>

<p>We had heard of her in the Marquesas Islands, and
I was anxious to make her acquaintance. During the
hard fight getting through the Paumota Archipelago,
we had forgotten about her. On the first night ashore,
as I was walking about the town in company with the
captain of one of the German schooners, my mind was
on other things. Life was gay in Papeete. There
were singing and dancing in the streets, accordions
everywhere, girls and boys strolling hand in hand or
eating fruit on the sidewalks. We had paused in the
centre of the market square, where life was the merriest.
Young people would stop their games to see who that
strange person was and what he was doing in Papeete.
I felt self-conscious as I moved along, the cynosure of
hundreds of pairs of eyes. Of a sudden, a white-clad
girl from the throng laughingly grabbed my hand,
and as if to ask a question, she said: "<i>Iaorana</i>, Missionary,"
which means: "Hello, Missionary." With
these people, everyone is a missionary until they find
out otherwise, and they always greet a stranger as a
missionary when he first lands. The captain with me
explained in their native tongue who I was, and then
I seemed to be taken in as one of them. Helene drew
us to the side of the street and made known that I
could buy her some flowers and fruit, and the captain
and I squatted on the sidewalk and ate watermelon,
while she chattered away, asking questions of the captain
as fast as he could answer them. Several other
girls halted enquiringly, and Helene with a gesture <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>p203</span>
told them to be seated with us. Then I bought more
flowers and fruit, and I commenced to wonder if I
was not "getting my leg pulled," until I paid the
whole bill and it amounted to something like ten cents.
As I had never had such a good time on so small an
amount of money, I got generous, and nodded to
another group of girls to join us, but I saw Helene
frown at them, and they turned away. This was the
first I saw of Helene's power, but later on I observed
that the white people as well as the natives treated her
with vastly more respect than the ordinary Kanaka
ever got.</p>

<p>On the day after I first met Helene, I had occasion
to go to Lavina's Hotel, where the Londons were staying.
I found Helene seated on the <i>lanai</i>, trying to
make Jack understand what she was saying. When
I came up the walk, she jumped to her feet, and said,
"<i>Iaorana oae</i>" and I noticed that she no longer
called me missionary, nor was I ever called missionary
again. I'm sure I never gave any of them cause to
mistake me for a missionary; in fact, after the crew
of the <i>Snark</i> had become acquainted in Papeete, I'm
afraid the real missionaries did not approve of our
keeping open house to the natives. But the good-natured,
hospitable people did us so many favours and
were constantly making us such generous presents of
fish that we made them welcome whenever they wished
to visit us. They would bring Jack bunches of their
cooking bananas from the mountains; and then Jack <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>p204</span>
would lay down his writing, pass around cigarettes, and
talk to them. We easily picked up their language, for
it is so simple that little effort is required in its use.
Through the kindly services of Ernest Darling, the
Nature Man, and Helene, we soon were talking without
any difficulty. The Tahitian language has only
about fourteen letters in its alphabet. There are no
singulars nor plurals, no modes, no tenses. Every
letter is pronounced. We were able to speak intelligibly
after a little practice.</p>

<p>Helene was an every-day visitor at the bungalow
belonging to Captain Y—— and myself, where she
would wear only the native <i>pareu</i>. This was allowable,
as we lived outside the centre of town. Had we
been resident closer in, the French government would
have forced all the native girls who came to see us
to wear <i>au-aus</i>. At times, Helene would bring certain
of her friends to the house, for they were always
sure of finding tobacco there. As I have said, all
through the South Seas the girls smoke as much as
the men, and think nothing of it, for the habit has been
with them since the very introduction of the weed.
And now it has such a hold on them that no worse
punishment could be inflicted on these people than to
deprive them of their tobacco.</p>

<p>One day while Jack was in California, Helene came
to the house wanting to borrow a dollar to buy medicine
to take to her mother. The French physician
stationed here charges one dollar to take a case, and <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>p205</span>
for that will supply the medicine and attend to the
case until the patient has no further use for him. A
small lugger had just come in from Raiatea, Helene's
home. The captain had been instructed to return at
once with Helene and the medicine, and I was at the
beach that afternoon when the boat sailed. I must
say that I was glad that I had sailed on a nice big boat
like the <i>Snark</i>, instead of on one of those little luggers.
Raiatea lies over a hundred miles away from Papeete.
And the boat was so small that none of the fifteen
passengers could go below. But Helene did not seem
to be afraid, and in ten days when she returned, she
brought a couple of dozen big watermelons, for she
knew that watermelons were the best present she could
give us.</p>

<p>One Sunday, Helene and I decided to go out buggy-riding,
thinking that we could make some good pictures.
Early in the morning, I went to the stable,
and was assured by a big, lazy Kanaka that in one
hour he would send me the best he had, and I
wondered what it would be, for all I could see was
an old cart, a broken-down hearse with the glass
sides smashed in, and a buggy made of parts of a
wagon and another buggy. At present it had one
wheel off. But in two hours I found out. When I
went to the gate, I saw the Kanaka beating a poor,
starved horse which would not move out of a walk,
and which stopped by our bungalow. Well, we drove,
I think, about five miles that day, when the horse refused <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>p206</span>
to go further. The top fell off the buggy, and
the harness broke several times. But anyway, we got
some fine pictures.</p>

<p>On one of the regular trips of the steamer <i>Mariposa</i>,
while getting my hair cut by the ship's barber,
as I sat in the chair I noticed several pairs of ladies'
shoes in boxes on the shelf. I don't know what use
the barber had for them, but it gave me an idea, and
as soon as I could find Captain Y—— I told him
of it, and then we hunted Helene and took her aboard
and fitted her out with shoes and stockings. It was
laughable to see her strut around Papeete that day.
The shoes hurt her feet, for she had never worn shoes
before. None of the native girls in Papeete had ever
worn shoes. That night she walked around the market
square so long that soon she was limping. Next
day she was again barefooted, and I never saw the
shoes again. In that she was like all the natives,
childish; they are anxious for something new, but soon
tire of it when they get it.</p>

<p>I would sit for hours telling her of the rest of the
world; of circuses, of trains, of tall skyscrapers.
She would listen as quiet as could be until I had finished,
and then ask questions. But it was not until
a man with a moving-picture machine came to Papeete
that I had the delight of seeing the height of her enjoyment.
At one end of the square, an enterprising
Frenchman built a frame building which he called
"Folies Bergere." Here every Saturday night he <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>p207</span>
gave moving pictures. I took Helene, and Captain
Y—— took Taaroa, another native girl. I never
enjoyed a show so much in my life. I secured seats
near the front, in such a position that Helene would
miss none of it. From the first picture to the last,
her face changed from expressions of astonishment
and delight to horror and fear. The whole audience
was in the same state of excitement. There were
reels of film showing large cities and railway trains,
and magic pictures that none of these people had ever
seen the like of. It was many a day before the
natives could understand that it was not supernatural.
And with my meagre knowledge of their language, I
was hard put to explain to them how it was done.</p>

<p>They were like frightened rabbits when the fire department
came charging down the street. When the
swift-rushing teams got close, looking as if they would
plunge out of the screen and into the audience, screams
went up and there was nearly a panic in the house.
How they laughed at the comic films! But the last
thing was supposed to be the devil in hell, pitching
people into the fire. Since seeing that, they were
afraid of the least sound. Afraid of the <i>deipelo</i>,
they said; and we could not convince them that the
picture was not real, for, they argued, if it was not
real, how could anyone take a picture of it?</p>

<p>When Jack came back from California, we learned
that we had been lost at sea, and that the <i>Snark</i> was
a very unseaworthy craft, anyway. Throughout the <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>p208</span>
States, newspapers and magazines had persisted in reporting
us dead, every last one of us. I was told that
an Oakland bank had even begun an agitation to wind
up the affairs of Jack London, deceased. And of
course the prophets of disaster had welcomed this evidence
of their own amazing foresight, this news of
prophecy fulfilled.</p>

<p>The engines of the <i>Snark</i> were still giving us trouble.
The big one was just like a watch that seems all right,
but won't run. It looked in fine condition, but often
refused to start, and developed a hot-box on some one
of the four cylinders when run for any length of time.</p>

<p>One night, along in the early part of March, Captain
Y—— came to me and asked me to stay on the
<i>Snark</i> for him for a little while. Away outside the
reef was a ship, just barely to be seen, that was shooting
skyrockets and cannon, as an evidence of distress.
It was thought to be one of the Maxwell trading
schooners, one month overdue from the southern Taumotu
islands. A little gasolene schooner was chartered,
and Captain Y—— and some others went out
to it. It was not the trading vessel after all, but (to
my great surprise) the Chinese war-junk <i>Whang-Ho</i>
which I had been aboard of in California. They were
sixty-eight days out of Frisco for New York; but the
<i>Whang-Ho</i> was never intended to be handled by modern
sailors; she had been blown to Papeete, leaking
badly—the men, we afterward found out, had been
obliged to pump her night and day. There were eight <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>p209</span>
in the crew, all Americans. Captain Y—— went
aboard, and made them pay one hundred and twenty-five
dollars to be towed in. Once safe on land, the
men swore they would go no farther in the ancient
junk.</p>

<p>The natives watched the <i>Whang-Ho</i> with considerable
awe. Never had they seen anything like it.
Certainly, the ship was the strangest thing afloat—great
eyes were painted on her square bow, the Chinese
thinking that a boat needs something to see with.
The big galley aft was painted yellow, and the
tall, tree-like masts were brilliant red. I believe the
<i>Whang-Ho</i> had once been in royal service in China.</p>

<p>Speaking of royalty, I think Ernest Darling might
well be called the King of the Open Air. He never
lives indoors—if he can help it. While at Papeete,
we learned his story, and an interesting story it is.</p>

<p>Twelve years before, he had been lying on a deathbed
in Portland, Oregon. It seemed that nothing could
be done to save him. He was a wreck. The doctor
told him what had caused his breakdown. Overstudy,
was the medico's verdict; overstudy had put the final
destructive touch on a constitution already broken and
enervated by two attacks of pneumonia. His body
was irreparably wasted, and his mind was fast going.</p>

<p>Ernest Darling lay on that bed of sickness, awaiting
inevitable death. He could not bear the slightest
noise. Medicine drove him desperate. The day
came when he could stand it no longer. He tottered <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>p210</span>
from his bed, escaped from the house, and crawled for
miles through the brush. Here, in the silent spaces,
close to nature's heart, he found rest and quiet. He
bathed in the soothing rays of the sun, stripping off all
clothing, clinging close to the moist earth as he bathed.
Life, full and free, seemed to flow into his veins as he
lay there. The sun was the real life-giver, he thought,
noting his relief; that, with the balmy air, was all that
he needed.</p>

<p>For three months he lived thus. He built him a
primitive house of leaves and grasses, roofed over with
bark. No meat passed his lips—only fruits and nuts,
with occasional bits of bread. Every day he put on
more weight, and the intolerable agony of his nerves
subsided.</p>

<p>But at the end of the three months, the heavy rains
forced him to return to Portland and take up once
more his abode in his father's house. Then came the
relapse. He lost all he had gained. A third time he
grappled with pneumonia, and came out of the struggle
nearer death than ever. His mind collapsed utterly.
Ernest Darling was tried by alienists, found insane,
and told that he had less than a month to live.</p>

<p>They took him to an asylum, where he was allowed
to live once more on fruits and nuts. Again strength
came to him. Leaving the sanatorium, he got a bicycle
and went south to California, where he attended
Stanford University for a year, going to his classes
as simply garbed as possible. When winter came, he <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>p211</span>
was obliged to head further south. Several times he
was arrested and tested for his sanity.</p>

<span class="caption">Mission Schooner trading among the Islands and

 <a class="imglst" href="#ILLUSTRATIONS">Imglst</a></span>
</div>

<p>Finding that no one would let him alone, and not
desiring to end his days in either an asylum or a jail,
he made his way to Hawaii. But there was no relief
for him. Here he was given his choice between leaving
Hawaii or going to prison for a year.</p>

<p>Darling went to Tahiti. And there, at last, after all
his wanderings and harassments, he found a haven.
The Tahitians and French neither jailed him nor questioned
his sanity. He spent his days in the open, on a
tract of land he bought, near Papeete; and his food he
picked from his own trees. When in town, he was
busy in such simple shopping as he found necessary,
or in expounding the principles of Socialism, in which
he was a devoted believer.</p>

<p>We had lived in Papeete three months and a half
before everything was ready for us to start again
through the islands. We had decided to visit the
island of Moorea first, then, on a special invitation
from Helene, we were going to Raiatea.</p>

<p>Before leaving Papeete, we got a new sailor, a
French boy named Ernest. Ernest was signed on the
French bark <i>Elizabeth</i> as ordinary seaman. When
our captain offered him a job on the <i>Snark</i>, he
ran away from the French ship, and lived on fruit in
the mountains until she had sailed, when he came down
and joined us. He was eighteen years old, spoke little
English, and was an all-around sailor. He had been <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>p212</span>
round the world twice. He was very tall—one
inch taller than I was—so that he was likewise obliged
to stoop when he went below.</p>

<p>We were three hours and forty minutes getting out
of Papeete Harbor and dropping anchor in Moorea
Bay. On this trip, the engine ran perfectly; and it is
hard to say which was the most pleased—Jack, Mrs.
London, or I. I took Mr. and Mrs. London ashore
in the launch, then came back and went to bed with a
terrible headache, and did not have time to get a
good idea of the bay until next morning. It is about
three quarters of a mile wide, by one and a half long,
and reminded me very much of Taiohae Bay in the
Marquesas. All around range the mountains, ragged
peaks with the sides one mass of green, with cocoanut
palms half way to the top. The beach was a jungle
of palms and bananas. With the glass, we could
count as many as seventy cocoanuts on one tree. All
day I painted the engine room, and that night walked
with Ernest two miles along the beach to the village,
which consisted of three Chinese stores and a bunch
of grass houses.</p>

<p>Along the way we met Kanakas, looking very cool,
dressed only in their <i>pareu</i> cloth.</p>

<p>"<i>Iaorana!</i>" they all greeted us, and with some
joke passed laughingly on. When we got aboard, I
started the searchlight, and turned it on the huts along
the beach. The Kanakas would come out and watch
us, and some of the <i>vahines hula-hula'd</i> for us. In the <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>p213</span>
glare of the light, I could see Jack and Mrs. London
eating in the open-air dining place of MacTavish, a
white man, who boards any person who ever drifts
to Moorea.</p>

<p>Next morning, I took the Londons out in the launch
to make photographs; but in an hour the launch-engine
stopped, and I had to land them, while I repaired it.
I had it in good running order again in an hour.</p>

<p>During our stay, Kanaka men and women and girls
paddled out, and we let them aboard. Great was their
curiosity at the electric lights. One Kanaka wanted to
turn them on and off so much that I had to switch the
current off at the engine room, so that the lights went
dead; but they could hardly keep away from the five-horse-power
engine, which I ran most of the time in
order to fill the storage batteries. I took some of the
girls out in the launch, to their almost frantic pleasure.
I towed an outrigger canoe with two girls across the
bay, and as quick as they could paddle back they wanted
me to do it again.</p>

<p>Darling, the Nature Man, and Young, a Socialist,
had accompanied us. It was amusing to see Darling
splash along shore in the shallow water, catching fish.
At times he lay in the shade of a tree, resting. When
a crowd of natives gathered around him, he would
jump up and yell like an Indian war dancer, which
performance always doubled the natives with laughter.
They all like Darling, and he likes them. He told us
that he knew he would be making a fool of himself <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>p214</span>
among white people, but that he liked to amuse the
Kanakas. Darling was full of energy—much different
from the wraith of a man who had lain on his bed
in Portland, Oregon, looking forward to nothing but
death. He chopped wood for Wada and made trips
up the mountains after fruit. He had the deck lined
with half a dozen different varieties of bananas.</p>

<p>The next day I spent in reading and sleeping, except
when I took the launch to go watch the Kanaka
boys fish. They first catch a small fish among the
coral banks, then bite out a chunk for bait; then another
chunk, which they eat. I have seen them eat fish raw,
just as they were pulled wriggling from the water.
But usually they soak them in vinegar before eating.
Raw fish is the favourite dish among the Kanakas. I
tried to develop an appetite, but I fear I made no
startling success.</p>

<p>We were a week at Moorea; then a casting on the
engine broke, making it necessary for us to return to
Papeete. It was just before we started back that a
long canoe, filled with men and women, paddled past
us and bombarded us with oranges until the decks were
covered, then paddled away, its occupants laughing
and shouting. Darling said the oranges were to pay
us for being so good to them. The Moorea orange
is nearly green in colour, and tastes the same as the
California variety.</p>

<p>We had difficulty in getting away. I had a short
circuit on the wires that I was puzzled to find; but <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>p215</span>
when we were finally able to start, I beat my record
coming over by forty-five minutes.</p>

<p>Arrived at Papeete, it took two days to put the
machinery in order again. We then set sail for Raiatea.
It was on April 4 that we cleared Papeete Harbor.
The usual large crowd had assembled to see us
off. After getting about five miles off the reef, I
stopped the engine, which was running splendidly.
We sailed all night with a fair breeze, and in the
morning sighted Huahina, which we steered for, but
kept one mile off the lee shore until we had left it
far behind. Soon Raiatea was sighted. Its ragged
peaks looked at a distance the same as Tahiti or
Moorea. When about twenty miles off, I started the
engine. We got through the reefs and anchored in
the bay by seven o'clock.</p>

<p>On account of engine repairs having delayed us,
Helene had given up our coming, and had gone to the
mountains to visit relatives. But she heard that we
were in the bay, and next day we were honoured by
a visit from her. She came out to the <i>Snark</i> in a
small canoe, and invited us ashore to her home. Jack
had promised us every night off while at this island,
so Ernest and I took the launch for shore. We
took a five-mile walk along the beach and up the mountain
to her mother's house. Along the shore, grass
huts were built on stilts over the water. Kanakas sat,
or rather squatted, all along the road, and each
greeted us in the native tongue. We found the house <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>p216</span>
away back among the mountains, a long, low grass
house, with a huge waterfall made by a mountain
stream in the rear. Oranges, limes, cocoanuts, papaias,
guavas, bananas, and several kinds of fruit I cannot
spell the name of, were thick for miles up and
down the valley. We found Helene, her mother and
her father, and several other members of the family,
and were given a hearty welcome. Ernest talked
French, Helene and her mother, Kanaka, while I used
English, French and Kanaka—and we all used gestures.
Her father could speak only the native tongue,
and was an ordinary Kanaka. Her mother was a
typical Tahitian. So I have never been able to understand
why Helene should be so far above her class.
Her environment had been no better; it must have
been some strength of character, some intrinsic worth,
that elevated her in station and in mind. Anyway,
she proved that she was a person of authority on her
own island when she ordered a big feast prepared in
our honour, and the natives gathered with roasted
wild boar and gave an imitation of their old-time
"long-pig" feast.</p>

<p>We stayed at Helene's home until one o'clock in
the morning. We remained four days on the island.
Helene came to the village, to stay while we were in
port. Later, we took a daylight trip to her mountain
home, in order to enjoy the natural beauties. The
scene from the waterfall was great. We had viewed
some wonderful scenery in the Hawaiian and Marquesas <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>p217</span>
Islands, but nothing to compare with this.
There was not a sign of cultivation anywhere—everything
in its wild natural state; and as for fruit, it was
everywhere in abundance, buds, blossoms, half-ripe and
ripe fruit on the trees at the same time.</p>

<p>Before going further with the voyage of the <i>Snark</i>,
and while the <i>Snark</i> is still anchored at Raiatea Island,
I want to tell of the comic opera war that once occurred
here.</p>

<p>The natives of Raiatea, tired of the French system
of government, pulled down the French flag, and raised
the flag of England. They put the French officials
then living in Raiatea adrift in open boats. These
people made their way to Papeete and informed the
governor, who had never seen any more active service
than strutting around the streets of Papeete, and did
not know what to do in such an emergency. The
governor went to the British consul stationed here, and
demanded that he cause the natives of Raiatea to lower
the British flag. Now the British consul was only a
figure-head, and had never attended to any duties other
than signing pratique papers for the British ships that
came here. Sometimes as many as two or three a
year dropped anchor in Papeete. The rest of the time
there was nothing to do. So now he was nonplussed.
Long debates took place. At last it was agreed that
both governor and consul should go to Raiatea and
put down the rebellion.</p>

<p>The French man-of-war <i>Zelle</i> transported them to <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>p218</span>
Raiatea, and the two officials landed under the white
flag of truce. The chiefs received them, and the two
emissaries demanded that they raise the French flag.
The chiefs refused, and gave the officers half an hour
to get back to the ship. Then the warship shelled the
village; but by that time all the natives had made for
the brush; and finally, after five or six days' shelling,
the sailors landed again and lowered the flag without
opposition, for the Kanakas had realised that their
fight was useless. But the funny thing about the whole
business was that for at least four days the warship
had been shelling an empty village.</p>

<p>The islands of Raiatea and Tahaa are in reality one
island that has been cut through the middle by some
volcanic disturbance. The distance from Raiatea
Island to Tahaa is less than seven miles. The tides
often sweep through here with such force that small
canoes have spent days getting across the channel.
Just as we were preparing to sail from Raiatea Island,
a tiny outrigger canoe with a big sail hove in sight.
In it was a big, almost naked Kanaka named Tehei.
He invited Jack and Mrs. London to take a ride in
his queer craft, an invitation they cheerfully accepted.
They went over to Tahaa, the island seven miles away,
and stayed two days, fishing and hunting. On their
return, we set out with the <i>Snark</i> through coral reefs
where a hundred feet either way would wreck us.
At Tahaa we picked up the Kanaka Tehei and his
wife, with two canoe-loads of fruit, a pig, chickens <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>p219</span>
and <i>poi</i>. Jack informed us that Tehei had begged
very hard to be allowed to go with us to the island of
Bora Bora, our last stop in the Society Islands, and
that he had yielded to his solicitations. Indeed,
Tehei had wanted to go clear to Samoa, but to this
Jack shook his head. Tehei had brought his wife,
Bihaura, along. To her, also, was given permission
to go with us to Bora Bora. Tehei and his wife returned
to their house, and early next morning, with a
light wind, we crossed the lagoon under power to the
point where Tehei and Bihaura were to meet us. As
we made into the land between banks of coral, we could
see Tehei among the trees, running down toward the
beach. He was afraid we would not see him, so he
pulled off his shirt and waved it as he ran. Once
aboard, Tehei informed us that we must proceed along
the land until we got opposite his house. He took
the wheel and guided the <i>Snark</i> through the coral, and
we reached the beach. Here was another offering of
fruit and fowl, two more canoe-loads awaiting us.</p>

<p>All the time that the fruit was being loaded in the
cockpit and aft the cockpit, piled up to the railing,
I had been letting the engine run free without the
propellers in gear; the old engine had never worked
better, and Jack was just commenting on how smoothly
it was running, when it gave a mighty backfire and
stopped, and in a very dangerous place, for the currents
were running very swift through here and there
was no wind that we might sail by. The crew on <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>p220</span>
deck, with the help of several Kanakas, braced the long
oars that we kept for the life-boat, and eight
oars worked an hour while I toiled at the engine
and finally got it running just as they were nearly
exhausted. I threw the clutch into gear again, and
with Tehei at the bow to look out for coral reefs,
we slowly threaded our way out of countless reefs projecting
only a few inches above the surface of the water.
Canoes skimmed over the water ahead, showing us
the way through the reefs.</p>

<p>Tehei was invaluable. Had it not been for him,
I do not believe we would ever have gotten out of that
maze of reefs. Now that I have a chance to think
over that day's work, I don't believe that I ever had
so much experience crowded into a single day before.</p>

<p>With the engines running smoothly, I would go on
deck and look over the rail, down on remote bottoms
where fish of every hue and colour played among the
dense forests of coral. Islands were on every side
of us, high rugged peaks, some of them a hundred
miles away, and near us small low atolls covered with
a riotous growth of cocoanuts. The day was perfect—very
little wind, and with the awning stretched
over the decks and all sails furled, we slid over the
smooth surface of the water straight for Bora Bora.
After we left the coral reefs behind, Tehei and Bihaura
lay down on deck and went to sleep. Jack and
Mrs. London were at work grinding out reading matter
for the American public, the rest of the crew were <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>p221</span>
asleep in their bunks, and I sat on the edge of the
open skylight and divided the time between watching
the engine and gazing over the dozens of small islands.</p>

<p>This was the real South Seas that I had read about,
dreamed about, and had never expected to see. Numerous
small canoes would put out from the islands
and try to board us, but we moved too fast for them,
and after paddling till they were out of breath, they
would drift back.</p>

<p>At noon dinner was served on deck, entirely of fruit
and raw fish. Then everyone went to sleep again, except
Captain Y—— at the wheel and myself at the
engine. About three in the afternoon the engine
started backfiring and knocking so that I was kept in
the engine room the rest of the day. With every
backfire, the cylinders would lose gas until the engine
room was almost unbearable to work in. But if we
were to get to Bora Bora that night, I must keep busy
with them. Our engine was a seventy-horse-power
Twentieth Century, with four cylinders. I would run
on two cylinders until they got hot, then turn them
off and turn on the other two, and so kept up the
hardest afternoon's work I ever did.</p>

<p>It was close to nine o'clock when we reached Bora
Bora, and by that time I was nearly dead; but I kept
working on the engines. I was doing the only thing
possible, though the last few hours seemed a blank to
me. The people on deck knew nothing about engines,
so they could not help me. They were unaware that <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>p222</span>
I was nearly dead below. I think that during the
last hour some power diabolical must have got hold
of the engine. I lost consciousness and fell on the
floor, and knew nothing till the big gong working in
the cockpit gave me the signal to stop the engine. I
aroused myself long enough to throw the switch and
crawl through the hatchway; then I knew nothing
more until several hours later, when I found Mrs.
London bathing my face in cold water and the Japanese
chafing my limbs with coarse towels. I was certainly
near death's door, nearer than I can ever get without
actually dying. They told me afterward that my heart
was barely beating.</p>

<p>And I think I realise what it must be to be dead,
for the only memory I have of that awful period is
that I thought I was dead. The gas gave me a queer
roaring sensation that seemed like some unearthly
music; and had not the gong sounded when it did, I
fear it would have been all the music I should ever
have heard. How I roused myself enough to shut
off the power and get on deck, is a mystery to me now.
Many times, even after the lapse of several years,
I awaken with that queer feeling of dying, and always
I seem to be aboard the <i>Snark</i>. It was barely midnight
when I gained consciousness, to hear the sound of
music and of singing floating across the quiet lagoon.</p>

<p>Next morning I was still weak, so I did not clean
my engines as I usually did after a long run, but went
ashore to see the life of Bora Bora.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>p223</span></p>

<p>The whole island rose up to entertain us, and the
good people gave us ten days of the best time I ever
had. Tehei's wife was of royal blood, and her influence
caused the natives to make special effort for our
entertainment. The night after our arrival, Tehei invited
Jack, Mrs. London, Captain Y—— and me
ashore, where we had a dinner such as surpasses description.
Fruits prepared in every way a true Kanaka
likes, sucking pig, chicken fried in cocoanut oil, watermelon,
and raw fish! This last is one of the choicest
of South Sea dishes. The fish, freshly caught, are
cleaned and soaked an hour in lime-juice. It is delicious.
Although we could speak very little with the
Kanakas, we enjoyed watching them, and they enjoyed
watching us.</p>

<p>After the meal, we went to a large oval, bamboo
missionary-house, and watched an old Kanaka missionary
drill what he called his <i>himines</i>. A score of
girls, decorated with flowers, formed a semi-circle in
front. Back of these stood the Kanaka men, and behind
them the boys. Their music was more like
grunts, but the wild, weird noise made my blood tingle.
The boys kept swaying their bodies with the song and
clapping their hands, at times beating themselves on
the chest and chanting. This finished, a surprise was
in store for us. Natives came in with chicken, watermelons,
vegetables, fruit and fish, and made a pile
that two boats the size of the <i>Snark</i> would find difficulty
in floating under. Then a big Kanaka got up <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>p224</span>
and presented it to us. Jack thanked them, but
had to decline the greater part, for want of carrying
capacity. Even as it was, our deck looked like a
market.</p>

<p>Bora Bora is a marvellous island. Twenty miles
in circumference, it is surrounded by dozens of smaller
islands, each in turn surrounded by its own coral reefs.
From our deck, I could count eight of these small islands,
some only a few acres, others about three or four
miles around, all covered, save for the sandy beach,
with a thick green jungle of tropical trees. We were
twenty-five miles from Raiatea and one thousand miles
from Samoa.</p>

<p>Only three persons on the island could speak English.
There were half a dozen frame huts; all the rest were
of grass, or bamboo. The natives wore nothing but
the red <i>pareus</i>, or breech-clouts.</p>

<p>We were anchored a half-mile out, but the launch
made the trip to the beach in a few minutes. The
whole deck was covered with awnings, and we ate and
slept on deck. The three engines were running all
right, though it kept me pretty busy attending to them;
it took a good deal of electricity just at that time, for
the fans were running almost without intermission, and
I had connected drop-lights on deck, whereby we might
see to read or write at night. The natives were unremitting
in their attentions. They came out by canoe-loads,
bringing us food of various sorts—that is, all
but the women, who found the ship "taboo."</p>

</div>

<p class="xpno"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>p225</p>

<p>Bora Bora was the most primitive place we had yet
visited. All along the beach, the long outrigger canoes
were propped up on logs cut out for the purpose.
The beach itself was sown thick with forgotten graves.
On the morning of the third day, Tehei came aboard,
and informed us that he had planned a mammoth stone-fishing
for us. It was to be the biggest in the history
of the island. Runners had been sent to the interior
of the island and around the coast. These men were
telling every inhabitant of Bora Bora about the stone-fishing;
and in the afternoon the people began to gather
in the village, and that night we were invited ashore
to a big entertainment, gotten up on the spur of the
moment. We were given seats on the grass in the
centre of the village green, and around us squatted
brown-skinned and black-haired men and women and
girls and boys. They would sing their weird, barbarous
tunes and keep time by swaying their bodies
and gesturing with the arms. Then a few of them
would dance, while the crowd cheered—not such
dances as we see in civilised places, but something so
strange and indescribable as to arouse the disbelief of
some who have never travelled in the South Seas.
They would dance so slowly that they would scarcely
be moving; then away they would go, like a mad
whirlwind. The crowd urged them on. Finally, the
dance would cease as abruptly as it had begun, while
the dancers would sink down exhausted. On going
aboard the <i>Snark</i> late that night, Jack remarked on the <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>p226</span>
contrast between their easy, care-free lives, and the
artificial, wearing lives of the so-called civilised people.</p>

<p>Early next morning we were awakened by the conch
shells, signalling for the people to gather at the beach.
This conch shell is used by heralds all through the
South Seas. Once heard, the sound is never forgotten.
I brought back a number of these shells, when I returned
to America.</p>

<p>Going on deck, I saw canoe-load after canoe-load of
natives putting off from the beach, and among them a
big double canoe paddled by fourteen girls. Two
men sat in the stern to steer, and on a little platform at
the bow, dancing and singing, were Tehei and Bihaura.
They had borrowed our large American flag, and had
it waving at the bow. This canoe-load of the belles
of Bora Bora came alongside the <i>Snark</i> and received
Jack and Mrs. London, while Captain Y—— and I
followed in the gasolene launch. I had nine kodaks
and cameras arranged in the launch, so that I could
use any one I wanted and use it quickly. From the
<i>Snark</i> to the place of the fishing was about three miles.
Riding in the launch, I often caught up with the other
canoes, then stopped the engine and drifted back again,
and sometimes I circled round the big double canoe.
Jack once asked me if I did not wish I were among
that bunch of girls, and he thought he was getting the
better of me, until I ran alongside and three of the girls
jumped in the launch, after which I sped on, with the <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>p227</span>
laugh on Jack. The girls had never been in a motor-boat
before, and they held on for dear life. The
launch outdistanced all the other boats, arriving at the
place of fishing half an hour before the rest.</p>

<p>After all the canoes had beached, the ceremony began.
Tehei assigned to each of the fishers his or her
duty; then nearly one hundred canoes, each with a
couple of men, paddled out from the shore about three
miles. And then, at a signal, the boats, which were
spread out in a long line, moved slowly toward the
shore, one man paddling and another rattling strings
of shells in the water, and all yelling at the top of their
voices. The men who paddled the canoes splashed as
much water as possible, while their companions rattled
the shells, the object being to frighten the fish toward
the shore, where the water was shallow. They gradually
closed in as they moved shoreward, while girls
with nets of leaves waded out in readiness to close in
on the canoes. The boats were an hour getting near
the beach. As they approached closer and closer, the
girls formed a palisade of their legs, and made a net
of leaves. And Tehei, armed with a spear, stood in
the corral formed by the girls. He was to kill the
first fish, and it was to be presented to Jack London,
along with the spear and an invitation to kill as many
as he might want. Such is Polynesian hospitality.
Tehei proudly made ready for the initial slaughter.
But the canoes drew closer and closer, and Tehei
rubbed his eyes in wonder. Then he dropped the <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>p228</span>
spear. There were no fish to kill. Tehei hunted for
fifteen minutes, and then, satisfied that there were no
fish within that human palisade, he turned to Jack, the
most forlorn looking person in Bora Bora. He was
ashamed of himself, he was ashamed of the rest of the
natives, and he was ashamed of the fish, and of Bora
Bora. The poor fellow felt so humiliated that Jack
hastened to invite as many as could crowd aboard the
<i>Snark</i> to join us in a feast that night. This they were
not slow in doing. That evening we fed them hardtack
and tinned salmon, which they washed down with
good old Holland gin. When they left, they declared
that they had never had such a good time before.</p>

<p>And so the days passed in this land of abundance.
Every day we were surrounded by canoes, anxious to
see the <i>Snark</i> and her white crew. The natives were
too polite to come aboard the <i>Snark</i> without being invited.
One day, when I was drowsing lazily on deck,
close to the engine room hatchway, so that I could keep
one eye on the dynamo engine, which was chugging
away filling the storage batteries for that night's run
of lights and fans, and the other eye on the water, a
big Kanaka paddled up close in his canoe, and asked
politely if he could come aboard and peep—just
peep—below into the engine room. Mrs. London,
sitting on the rail, pointed to a big watermelon in the
canoe, and made known to the Kanaka that I was inordinately
fond of watermelon. Immediately, the native
passed over the melon to me, and I took him below. <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>p229</span>
His astonishment was supreme at the maze of
machinery, lights that turned on and off at will, and the
most wonderful thing of all, fans! Then I started the
big engine for him, and he left the engine room with
his head in a whirl.</p>

<p>That afternoon, canoe-load after canoe-load of
watermelons came off to the <i>Snark</i>, and each time I
would exhibit the engine room; and once, while a crowd
of natives were on deck, I gave one two live ends of
electric wire. With a yell he jumped overboard, and
after that they were careful not to touch anything that
I had aught to do with.</p>

<p>Bihaura, being of royal blood, had houses in several
of the adjoining islands. The one in Bora Bora was
her headquarters. One day while at her home, I noticed
a large eight-day clock hanging on the wall. It
looked as if it had not run for years. Examining it,
I found that all it needed was cleaning, so I took it
aboard and put it in good shape. Then I hung it again
on her wall, and started it running. It was the only
timepiece on the island. The natives would peek in
at the door and watch and wonder. Next day, a
Kanaka stopped me, with about half a dozen old clock
wheels that he wanted me to make into a clock. I
fell several points in Bora Bora estimation when I was
forced to acknowledge that I could not tinker the old
wheels into an effective clock: but next night I regained
what I had lost when I made the graphophone
talk.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>p230</span></p>

<p>Jack had taken the machine ashore, and was playing
to several hundred people in the <i>himine</i> house, when
the rachet spring slipped out of position, making it
impossible to wind the machine. Jack send aboard
for me, and I came ashore and straightened the spring
in position, a thing Jack could have done had he
thought of it. But he didn't think of it—and immediately
I was restored to high favour among the Bora
Bora natives.</p>

<p>After ten days of this delightful life, it was time
for us to go. On the day of sailing, the natives tried
to outdo all their previous generosity, piling the <i>Snark</i>
knee-deep with abundance of fruit, chickens, vegetables,
fish, and other good things. There were yams, taro,
cocoanuts, limes, bananas, papaias, pineapples and
pomegranates. The life-boat, the launch, and the
deck were piled full. And when, at one o'clock on
the afternoon of April 15, 1908, we set sail from
Bora Bora, hundreds of natives came to the beach to
shake our hands, and to wish us a safe voyage and a
quick return.</p>

<p>We were genuinely sorry to leave. Our hearts'
roots seemed to have found grateful soil in Bora Bora.
The place is a happy paradise; and the life is one to
envy. Everything seems to work for good to the natives.
If a man's house gets old, and he wants to
move, he need only spend a few days gathering palm-leaves
and bamboo; then his new habitation can be
built in a day. The man of Bora Bora need not cultivate <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>p231</span>
his land—Nature does it for him. The earth
bears prosperously, a hundred times more than can be
eaten. What has civilisation to offer that can sway
the balance of one's judgment in its favour?</p>

<p>When we sailed from this happy island, we carried
with us a new member of the crew. Jack had yielded
at last to Tehei's pleas, and had consented to allow
him to go with us. Bihaura was taken back to Tahaa
by six lusty Kanakas in a cutter.</p>

<p>We made our way straight out of the reef. It was
a great relief to me to be able to be on deck, viewing
the scenery, instead of down in the engine room.
Tehei proved a valuable helper. He was a full-blooded
Kanaka, thirty years of age, and could speak no
English, but none the less, he was able to understand
Captain Y—— 's orders. For the first day and night,
however, he spent most of his time weeping and praying,
for he was unused to leaving home, and moreover
was seasick.</p>

<p>I stayed on deck all afternoon, taking my last look
at the Society Islands. We were now bound for the
Samoan group, a ten-day run as we figured it. The
<i>Snark</i> was so thickly packed with presents of all sorts
that there was hardly room to walk, even though every
toss of the boat sent bushels of oranges, bananas, and
other fruits sliding into the sea. When I went to bed,
the island we had so lately quitted was still visible.</p>

<p>On April 19, we were calmed. The sails flapped,
the <i>Snark</i> rose and fell with the swell of the ocean, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>p232</span>
but we made little progress. That night Jack read
to us an article he had written, entitled: "The Other
Animals"—a reply to President Roosevelt and John
Burroughs, who had charged Jack with being a "nature
faker." Jack had intended to make no reply to the
charge, but a big American magazine kept after him
so persistently that he could not refuse. On the 20th,
I spent some hours painting the engine room and the
engines. These latter I coloured dark brown, with
the pipes red; the walls I made a yellowish-brown, and
the dynamo black. I then polished all the working
parts like a mirror. And when I had finished, I called
in the crew, for I knew that seeing the ship trim and
shipshape always encouraged them. The next day I
put in in developing and printing pictures for Jack.
Nakata, Jack, Tehei and myself wore nothing during
this time but <i>pareu</i> loin-cloths, and the rest garbed
themselves as simply as possible, for the heat was overpowering.
It did not prevent our boxing, however—Jack
and I had five rounds in the evening, and I got a
cut lip and he a scraped nose. Jack is an expert boxer,
but I had the advantage on reach. While I was busy
below, the men on deck painted everything above white,
and looked to the condition of every shroud, halyard
and timber. As Captain Y—— said, the little ketch
had "put on her glad rags."</p>

<p>Everyone slept on deck, Jack and Mrs. London
on the starboard side, Ernest, Nakata, Wada and
Tehei on port, mid deck, captain aft the cockpit, and <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>p233</span>
I slept away up in the bow. The southeast trades
made life bearable on these hot nights; while we could
not feel them on the sails, we could feel them on our
faces, blowing gently and fitfully. Before going to bed
on the night of the 25th, Jack read to us his latest
Story, "the Chinago," the scene of which was laid
at Papeete. The night before we had heard "The
Seed of McCoy."</p>

<p>The small crew of the <i>Snark</i> was now getting to
feel more at home on water than on land. We were
getting into the thickest of the South Sea islands;
every mile we moved toward the west was bringing
us among more primitive people.</p>

<p>The wind was so light that we moved along very
slowly. The sea was almost as smooth as a mill-pond,
and we progressed with all sail set wing-and-wing.
There was very little work to do on board except to
keep watch. We would lounge around on deck and
eat fruit or play cards. Mrs. London had brought
with her a small instrument from the Hawaiian Islands,
a <i>ukelele</i>. This instrument is seldom seen outside
the Hawaiian Islands, for despite its sweet tones,
no other nation has taken up its use.</p>

<p>Mrs. London would play and sing in the evenings,
while Tehei and Wada and Nakata would do their
native dances. Sometimes Jack would read aloud his
day's work. And all the time we were sliding west
thicker into the heart of the South Pacific. We enjoyed
this part of the cruise very much indeed. Jack <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>p234</span>
had tops and skipping ropes aboard the <i>Snark</i>. The
ropes gave us much needed exercise; and we all
took boyish pleasure in spinning the tops. I have seen
Jack London squat down and spin his tops by the hour,
thoroughly absorbed in the fun. He said that this,
like his cigarettes, soothed his nerves.</p>

<p>We were thirteen days from Bora Bora when we
sighted the Manua Islands, with the largest island in
the group straight ahead. The Manua Islands really
belong to the Samoan Group, and are usually
charted as such; but the three small islands, about one
mile apart, are nearly one hundred miles from the
Samoan group proper. The natives are the same class
of people, and they speak the same language.</p>

<p>When Germany and England and America decided
to stop quarrelling over their property in the South
Seas, representatives of the three countries met at Apia,
Samoa, and England agreed to take over some western
islands, and quit the Samoan group entirely. So the
group was divided between Germany and the United
States. Germany kept the two large islands of Upolu
and Savaii, while America took the large island of
Tutuila and the small Manua Islands.</p>

<p>The natives objected to these powers coming here
and taking possession of them; and for many years
there was continual warfare in the German section.
The United States had no trouble in the island of
Tutuila, but in the Manua group, the old king at first
refused to acknowledge their sovereignty. Old King <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>p235</span>
Tui-Manua made a trip to the United States, and
after that he gave up the fight, for he saw the hopelessness
of his position; his one thousand subjects in the
Manua Islands could be wiped off the face of the earth
in a single day. Old Tui-Manua was wise enough
to submit; and he now governs the islands with nearly
as much authority as he had before. The United
States did not want the islands for the sake of ruling
them, but they wanted a coaling-station at Tutuila.</p>

<p>We sighted the largest island, known as "Au,"
early on the morning of the thirteenth day from Bora
Bora. As the wind was still very light, I set the engines
to work, and by noon we were under the lee of the
island, gliding along about one mile from the shore.
A person who has never been in the South Seas cannot
appreciate the pleasure of gliding along a tropical
bay, just close enough to see the small grass villages
and the dense jungles behind; the seas breaking over
the coral reefs ahead, and the pure blue waters underneath;
the tropical birds flying overhead, and canoes
paddling along the shores. And with the exception
of the rumbling of the sea over the reefs and the chattering
of the birds, everything is still and peaceful.</p>

<p>Such were the conditions as the <i>Snark</i> moved along
looking for an anchorage, but the coast seemed straight,
and unindented by a bay suitable for anchoring; and
the reef running outside and all along the coast kept
us from getting very close to land. Finally, we slowed
down until we were scarcely moving. We were undecided <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>p236</span>
what to do; but suddenly a shout went up from
the shore, and a big whale-boat was pushed down the
beach, and as it touched the water, a score of natives
jumped in. After fifteen minutes spent in getting
across the reef, they headed for the <i>Snark</i>.</p>

<p>I have often thought what a fine cinematograph-picture
that boat would have made, as it was tossed
right and left; first its bow would seem to be pointing
toward the sky, then down it would come while the
stern went up. When the boat came alongside the
<i>Snark</i> the natives were nearly exhausted from their
hard work. They would not come aboard for a long
time, but sat holding on to a stern-rope, trying to make
out who we were. Tehei could not speak their language,
and they could speak no English. We tried to
tell them that we were looking for an anchorage, but
it was not until Jack took several of them forward and
pointed to the anchor that they understood. Then
with a whoop they made fast a line from our bow to
the stern of their boat, and with every one of the
natives yelling at the top of his voice, we were towed
into anchor close to the reef. The men, not knowing
of the engine, felt that the only way for us to get in to
shore was for them to tow us. We stowed everything,
and after we had come to anchor we were surrounded
by canoes of the oddest shapes. Jack and Mrs. London
climbed into the big boat with the natives, and
soon were ashore, but the rest of the crew remained
on board to get things shipshape after the two weeks <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>p237</span>
at sea. I got my engines in trim; then I bribed a native
with a sack of Bull Durham tobacco to take me
ashore in his one-man canoe. I say "one-man canoe,"
for their canoes are made to carry from one to a dozen
men, and they are not safe with a single man more than
they are built to carry. We got safely across the reef,
when a wave broke over the boat, and we sank—and
it was up to me to swim ashore while a hundred natives,
standing on the beach, cheered; and it was their willing
hands that drew me from the water. It was a rather
embarrassing introduction to the natives of the Manua
Islands; but I was such a funny figure when I surveyed
myself that I had to laugh, too.</p>

<p>The natives crowded around me and laughed heartily
at my condition, and one took me by the arm and
led me to a large house in the centre of the grass village.
The natives followed until they were a dozen feet from
the house, when they stopped. Jack and Mrs. London,
hearing the noise, came out of the house, followed
by a tall, stately looking man, dressed in a white coat
and <i>sulu</i>. There could be no mistaking this man: he
was the king. The natives all bowed and salaamed,
while I stood between the natives and the king, uncertain
what to do. My clothes were a sight, drenched
with salt-water. After a glance at me, the king and
the Londons broke out laughing; then I had to laugh
again; and then all the natives started laughing, and
one, separating himself from the throng, stepped up
and told the king about my adventure. I could not
understand him, but I knew by his gestures that he was
talking about me. Then the king motioned for me
to step up on the porch, and we shook hands. Turning,
he called for the queen to come out. She was an
intelligent, fine looking woman, with excellent manners.
After shaking hands, she called for the servant, and
ordered that their native drink be brought. A
pretty little girl came with <i>kava</i> in cocoanut shells; and
after a toast by the king, we drank it down. It had a
queer, bitter taste, but I managed to swallow it. I
afterward found that I could not have offended the
king worse than by not drinking the <i>kava</i> at one
gulp. I was lucky in doing it just right. Jack and
Mrs. London sat down on the porch, and left me with
the king and queen. Now, I was not used to being
entertained by royalty, so I did not know how to act.
But I was relieved of a painful situation by all the
natives rushing off to the beach, whither the king and
queen followed them. The Londons and I went likewise;
and we saw a small schooner drop anchor close
to the <i>Snark</i>. She carried an English flag, which
dipped in response to a salute from the <i>Snark</i>. Then
they lowered a boat, and a white man was rowed ashore
by a dozen native sailors. When the man landed, he
shook hands with the king and queen, and spoke to
them in their native language; after which he turned
to us and spoke in English. He was the captain of
the schooner and also the owner. Though he did not
tell us his story, we afterward found it out.</p>

<p>Captain Young had come to the Manua Islands
when a young man, had opened a trading station, and
married a sister of the king. They had one daughter,
who grew up to be the belle of the islands. Young
had all the people in her favour; not that they were
dissatisfied with Tui-Manua, but they were one and
all fascinated by the beautiful girl. Tui-Manua got
hold of a rumour that he was to be dethroned, and
Captain Young's daughter was to be instated in his
place; so he forced Young and his wife to leave the
island. They lived on one of the other islands for
nearly a year, when the girl took sick; and when she
found she was going to die, she asked leave to die on
her native soil. Tui-Manua, hearing of the case,
allowed Captain Young and his family to return. The
girl died, and Young erected a big monument over her
grave. Now, while the king and the captain seem to
be friends, they are constantly in secret fear of each
other.</p>

<p>Tui-Manua invited us three from the <i>Snark</i> and
Captain Young to stay for supper. We had new
dishes that I was unfamiliar with, and we drank <i>kava</i>,
while we were waited on by the king's servants; and
afterward, when it got dark, the king ordered a big
fire built in the centre of the village, and native men
and women danced and sang for our entertainment, the
while we sat with the king on mats thrown on the
ground.</p>

<p>Next day, I went around the village making photographs, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>p240</span>
and going in and out of the natives' grass
huts. In one place I found a tattooer working on a
boy; and he asked to tattoo me, but to his great disappointment,
I refused.</p>

<p>With the trader as interpreter, Jack made the king
understand that we wanted to buy curios. The king
sent runners to collect the entire village, whom he told
to be on hand next day with things they wanted to sell.
And next day Jack and Mrs. London and I stood in
the centre of several hundred natives, buying mats and
war clubs and tapa cloth; and I was lucky enough to
secure a big, bushy grass fan, with which a native had
been busy keeping the flies off the king. It has the
king's name on it, and it is now reposing in the midst
of the other things I brought home with me from the
South Seas.</p>

<p>We lay anchored off the island of Au several days,
while, in company with the king and queen, we were
shown over the island by Captain Young. The day
we prepared to leave, the king and queen gave us
presents—one of the most valuable of these an
extra fine piece of tapa cloth, which I still retain.</p>

<p>The day we left Au, the king and queen came off
to the <i>Snark</i> and had dinner with us. Wada did gloriously,
cooking for royalty, and Nakata was more
polite than ever; and as we heaved anchor that afternoon,
the boat bearing the king and queen circled the
<i>Snark</i> three times, its occupants singing "Tofa-Mai-Feleni,"
the native song of farewell.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>p241</span></p>

<p>Tui-Manua is the descendant of a long line of the
most powerful South Sea Island kings. His father's
authority stretched for thousands of miles around, and
whatever he said took precedence over anything said
by any of the lesser kings within this boundary. So
it is rather humiliating to the present king to have to
bow down to another power stronger than he. He
is afflicted by a peculiar disease that is wasting his life
away; and ere long we will hear of his death. The
last of the true royalty of the South Seas will have
passed from earth. I have met members of many of
the South Sea royal families since then, but none deserved
the name of king so well as did Tui-Manua.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X<br />
THE SAMOAN GROUP</h2>
<p class="toclink"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></p>
<p>The Manua Islands are only ninety miles from the
island of Tutuila. This latter island is sometimes
called Pago-Pago, after the village of Pago-Pago, which
is on the southeast coast, and where the United States
coaling station is situated. Either name is correct.</p>

<p>We were all of one night in sailing from the Manuas
to Tutuila, and were calmed off the opening of Pago-Pago
Bay for several hours in the morning. Then I set
the engines in motion, and for a couple of hours we
threaded up the narrow bay until it opened out into
the prettiest land-locked harbour I have ever seen.
Mountains were on every side. The village of Pago-Pago
is set on the shores and up the mountainsides,
with Governor Moore's residence on the highest point
in the bay.</p>

<p>We sailed past the battleship <i>Annapolis</i>, the same
ship that had given us such a pleasant reception in
Papeete, Tahiti, one month before. We were expected,
and the jackies and officers and the men stationed
ashore were on the decks and lined up on
the beach. The band, composed of Samoan (native)
musicians, stood around the big flag-pole on the
beach and played national airs while the flag was
dipped in salute. It was a great day for us, and a <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>p243</span>
great day for the <i>Annapolis</i>, when the <i>Snark</i> came in
the bay. Just imagine three hundred Americans
away down here on a little island in the centre of the
South Seas, seeing no one from home for months and
months! Sometimes even a year goes by with no
American visitors. The <i>Snark</i> had been expected for
weeks, and the minute we were sighted a boat-load of
officers came aboard with invitations for everyone on
the yacht.</p>

<p>We had not dropped anchor when the officers came
aboard, and so busy were we, shaking hands with fellow-countrymen,
that Captain Y—— forgot to give
orders to drop the anchor until we were so close to
shore that it would have been dangerous to do so on
account of the coral reef. I had stopped the engines,
and we were drifting in, when the officers saw our
danger, and then some half-dozen of the highest officers
on the battleship <i>Annapolis</i> got out in their boat
with a line to our bow, and worked like coolies to
keep us off the shore. When I had gotten the engines
to running, they guided us to a place of safety.</p>

<p>These officers, who never got their hands dirty on
their own ship, finally, after the anchor had been
dropped, went ashore to doctor hands that were blistered;
but they never lost one grain of respect from
their men, who were watching from ashore, unable to
help because of not having a boat handy.</p>

<p>The battleship <i>Annapolis</i> is stationed here the year
round. The two hundred men who compose her crew <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>p244</span>
live ashore in their own homes, while about one hundred
men in command of the shore station have wives
and families and nice little bungalows. Many of the
sailors have Samoan wives, and many of them live
what is known as <i>Fas-Samoan</i>, which means residing
in grass houses and sleeping on grass mats thrown on
the ground, and eating native foods. So far as I could
see, they are the happiest lot of men in the world. Of
course, life must have been very monotonous at first,
but after they once got settled they formed a more
contented colony than any persons of the same number
in America. They have their clubs and baseball diamond;
all the literature they care for they get every
six weeks; they give balls and parties, and, as they
are sure of their jobs, have nothing to worry over.</p>

<p>And it is certainly a pretty sight they make in their
pure white uniforms. The Samoans that form the
national guard are all dressed alike, in blue <i>lava-lavas</i>
and white singlets. About one dozen of the chief officers
have fine mansions. Governor Moore's is the
finest of them all, and sits high above the rest. One
officer owns an automobile, and many have motor-boats.</p>

<p>We lay in Pago-Pago Harbor one week. During
this time we were living ashore with friends, that is,
all but Tehei, who, not speaking English nor Samoan,
preferred to remain aboard. We had been in the bay
a couple of days when a big six-foot-one native came
on board, and in excellent English said he was a Tahitian
and that he had heard we had a Tahitian with <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>p245</span>
us. We called Tehei. The big man went up and
spoke to Tehei in his own tongue; and Tehei was overjoyed
to find someone he could talk to. The big Tahitian's
name was Henry—a native of Rapa Island.
He was then captain of a small trading schooner that
plied in the Samoan group. He and Tehei became
close friends, and on the day that we prepared to leave,
Henry struck Jack for a job. As Henry was acquainted
with the islands that we intended to visit
next, Jack decided to hire him. Ernest, the French
sailor, was discharged. Ernest had proved a disappointment,
so we did not regret the change. Jack
bought him a ticket for Auckland, New Zealand (for
no one can remain in Samoa without one hundred and
fifty dollars in his pocket), and he left on the steamer
<i>Nuvina</i>. Henry, however, was a very good sailor,
having spent twelve years in the South Seas and in
Europe in the French navy. He spoke French, English,
German, and all the principal South Sea languages.
Weighing nearly two hundred pounds, and
six feet one inch in height, he was a mountain of muscle;
and he knew more about every part of the ship
than any person I have ever seen.</p>

<p>Henry's ship was turned over to a Samoan captain,
and amid the cheers of three hundred Americans and
a salute from the big guns on the <i>Annapolis</i>, we shoved
out of the harbour under Henry's steerage. He kept
the wheel all night, and early next morning we dropped
anchor in the harbour of the largest city in Polynesia: <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>p246</span>
Apia, Samoa. Several small schooners and
a steamer were anchored close to us; and ahead,
the white coral city that has been wrecked by revolutions
and hurricanes a dozen times, until it now resembles
an old European city with decayed castles.
Between us, on the beach, lay the old hull of a German
warship that had been wrecked here during a
hurricane in 1889. The Germans had tried to dynamite
it to pieces, but when they had broken nearly
all the windows in the town and the old hull refused
to budge, they decided to let it lie until it rusted away.
But for twenty years it had defied rust and shown no
sign of leaving its resting-place, and I don't believe
the residents would allow it to be removed now, for
it would not seem like Apia Harbor without that old
hulk.</p>

<p>Apia has a population of about five thousand.
About four hundred are Germans and Australians,
and the rest are alien South Sea Islanders and native
Samoans. Here the Germans have pursued the same
policy as in all their larger possessions. They maintain
a warship and a company of German soldiers on
duty all the time. Their police system is entirely of
natives, and they have a large standing army of native
soldiers.</p>

<p>The city is built for about three miles around the
bay. Most of the buildings are of white coral cement,
showing up like white marble from the sea. Back
from the sea are the native grass houses; in fact, a <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a>p247</span>
native of any of the South Sea islands will never live
in any other than a grass house, from choice. He
may live in a white man's house if he is a chief of
royal blood, but he will usually have a grass house in
connection, to go to when he can no longer stand the
coral one.</p>

<p>Apia is a half-way station for steamers bound to
and from Australia and America. Several steamers
from New Zealand pay monthly visits to obtain copra.
These steamers usually stay in the harbour for several
days; and as the ships cannot draw up to the wharves,
they must lie out nearly a mile while the copra is
loaded from barges. The natives with boats do a
profitable business carrying people to and from ships;
and they hire out as guides and take the tourists to
Robert Louis Stevenson's old home, and through the
largest cocoanut plantation in the world. And when
a steamer is seen to drop anchor, the professional entertainers
give a big dance. The hat is passed around,
and the natives always make a good sum of money.</p>

<p>Apia, Papeete, and Suva, Fiji, are practically the
only places in Polynesia where money has a value
among the natives. At Apia, the natives know its
value so well that they devise every scheme to obtain
it, and have developed their money-getting qualities
as perfectly as Americans. The best scheme is their
semi-annual boat races. Twice a year natives come
from all over the islands and enter their boats; betting
stands spring up on the beach, and every native who <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>p248</span>
can dig up money will stake all he has on his favourite
boat. At such regattas, there are usually excursion
steamers from Australia and New Zealand.</p>

<p>Apia is a port of the most famous missionary steamer
in the world, the <i>Southern Cross</i>. The steamer fits
out every three months at Auckland and goes among
the dark and little-known New Hebrides and Solomon
Islands. Then she returns and puts such converts as
she has found in a missionary school—later to be
turned out as full-fledged missionaries and taken back
to their homes, there either to backslide into a worse
state of cannibalism than that of their fellows, or else
to preach the word of God. When a savage from the
Solomons does backslide, he is usually the most cannibalistic
of his tribe.</p>

<p>Apia, Samoa, was the only real home that Robert
Louis Stevenson ever knew. While a young man in
Scotland, he was very seldom at home. He made
walking trips over England and France, and came to
America in the hold of an emigrant ship. After trying
to settle down in California, he finally gave it up,
and with his wife and her son, Lloyd Osbourne, he
chartered the sailing-yacht <i>Casco</i> and spent several
years cruising in the South Seas, at last settling
down in Apia. About four miles back of the city he
built his home on the side of a mountain, where he
could command a view of the city and the surrounding
bay. This home he named Vailima. Here, with his
wife, and Lloyd Osbourne, his secretary, he lived the <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a>p249</span>
last years of his life. It was here that he wrote several
volumes of South Sea stories.</p>

<p>Stevenson lost no time in making friends with the
natives: it was the delight of his life to entertain
them at his home. He would take part in their sports;
and one chief, who had taken a fancy to him, lived
at Vailima, and at certain hours every day he taught
Stevenson the Samoan language, while Stevenson
taught the chief English. At the top of the mountain,
Stevenson built a little pagoda, where he went nearly
every day to write. A narrow path had been cut up
to the summit through jungles of bananas and guavas,
and he would toil for hours in reaching the top. The
natives had so much confidence in him that all their
troubles and differences were brought to him for settlement.
Except in the mornings, which he spent in
writing, his time was entirely taken up with the Samoans.</p>

<p>Those who have read many of his works will notice
that his characters are almost all big, strong, healthy
people—just the opposite of Stevenson, who was always
a thin, sickly man. In fact, people who knew
him say that he had no use at all for a puny person.</p>

<p>The last year of his life was practically spent in
bed, where he wrote his best stories. Along toward
the end, the natives would gather in a body and stand
around the house in silence, awaiting news of his illness.
The last few days there were hundreds and hundreds
of natives outside the house, awaiting the end, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>p250</span>
and when it came, early one morning in 1894, the
natives set up the death chant, which spread along
their lines until the whole island was wailing at once.
Work suspended throughout the island until after the
funeral.</p>

<p>Stevenson had requested that he be buried at the
summit of the mountain. His coffin was carried by
chiefs, while other natives with big knives blazed a
road ahead for the procession, through the jungles and
to the top.</p>

<p>Of course, the <i>Snark's</i> crew made a visit to Vailima,
and then on up to the top, to the grave—nearly ten
miles of toil.</p>

<p>At Apia, the German government boasts of the best
outfitted observatory in Oceania. Here are all the
latest astronomical instruments in charge of ten expert
astronomers. It is a splendid set of instruments
they have, but—as a native remarked—what is the
use of them in Samoa, where there are no cable connections,
and should the astronomers see a comet coming
toward the earth, they would be so long in letting
the greater portion of the people know that there
would be no time to dodge!</p>

<p>Apia was the scene of slavery for many years. The
schooners would leave here and go among the Solomons
and Fiji Islands and steal the natives—<i>blackbird</i>
them, as they call it. The natives were then brought
to Apia and sold to planters and slave traders, until
the German government put a stop to this illegal <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>p251</span>
traffic; but even now, about five hundred blacks a year
are brought into these islands, and while the dealers
can always give a satisfactory recruiting paper for
each native, it is doubtful if the natives ever knew
what kind of papers they were signing.</p>

<p>It was in Apia that we learned an interesting piece
of Tehei's history. One day while I was walking down
the beach road in company with him, a white woman
stepped up, and throwing her arms around him, nearly
smothered him with her embraces. I thought she was
insane, until she started talking with him in his native
tongue; and then, turning to me, she told me that
Tehei was once sailing in a pearl-lugger among the
Taumotu Islands, in a boat captained and owned by
her brother. A hurricane had surprised the small
crew, and the boat was blown to pieces. The crew
was drowned—all but Tehei, who, clinging to a
hatch-cover, was washed ashore on one of the reefs
where pearlers were at work, and a few months later
returned to his home in an open boat that he had worked
for while on the reef. He made his way nearly four
hundred miles in this open boat, with only a luggersail
for power. Tehei had never told of this adventure,
but we afterward heard several remarkable exploits
of his among the pearling islands.</p>

<p>Apia is full of interesting characters—old beach-combers
and retired black-birders, captains and runaway
sailors, and ticket-of-leave men from Australia.
I know of one man, one of the greatest business men <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>p252</span>
in the town, who is an escaped convict from the French
penal settlement in New Caledonia.</p>

<p>The climate here is perfect. With a big wide sandy
beach running for miles round the bay, Apia would be
an ideal pleasure resort if the steamship connections
were better, and if it were nearer to civilisation.</p>

<p>The entire crew of the <i>Snark</i> lived ashore while
in Apia, although each one took turn-about staying
on board at night. Everything possible was done to
make our stay pleasant. Charley Roberts, a race-horse
owner, who was ruled off the turf, first in England,
then in America, then in Australia, and finally in
New Zealand, had come to Apia that he might race
horses undisturbed. He had two thoroughbreds
shipped from New Zealand; and two aged horses were
matched against Charley's thoroughbreds every few
weeks; bills were gotten out telling of the big meet,
and then the four horses would pull off race after
race, always with the same result. Roberts' mind was
wholly centred on this sport while we were there.
Horses were his one passion. And as he had means,
his relatives in Australia were content to have him
race horses in Samoa. He got up a special race for
us; in fact, he is always glad to have a meet. Anyone
going to Apia should have Charley call a meeting
of the Apia Turf Association—it would be heartily
enjoyed all around.</p>

<p>After two weeks in Apia, we slowly sailed out of the <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>p253</span>
harbour late in the afternoon. Charley Roberts and
some friends went out with us as far as they dared,
and loaded us down with wines, and, most important
of all, eggs.</p>

<p>It was just sundown on one of the most perfect
of South Sea evenings that we cleared the island of
Upolu and headed for the island of Savaii, only twenty-five
miles away. As it became darker, the sky ahead
grew red, and as we approached the island we could
clearly see tongues of fire issuing from the mouth of
the big crater, and gradually small threads of fire
running down the mountainside—threads that grew
into glowing torrents as we came closer, until by midnight
we were sailing up the coast of an island that
seemed to be literally aflame. The crater of the volcano
is twenty-five miles inland, and about ten thousand
feet high, the land sloping gradually down to the sea,
where it ends in an abrupt precipice, one hundred feet
high. For miles and miles, red-hot sputtering lava
rolled into the sea, sending up clouds of vapour. Two
miles from the seashore, we could read print plainly.
As we were getting into the lee of the land, where the
wind was likely to drop any minute, Jack told me to
start the engines; then we slid along the shore, edging
in as far as possible. The air got hot and sultry, and
steam was rising from the water all about us. Jack
stationed the cook in the bow with a thermometer, and
every few minutes he would cry the temperature, until <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>p254</span>
the water was nearly at boiling-point; then we were
afraid to go in farther on account of the thousand gallons
of gasolene aboard.</p>

<p>Henry, our new Kanaka sailor, knew this coast well,
and was to take us to a certain village where he was
known, but at nearly two o'clock in the morning we
were still skirting the rivers of lava, and the village
was not in sight. By the light of the boiling lava we
could see ruined villages and hundreds of thousands
of naked cocoanut trees, stripped of their foliage and
standing straight and threadbare in the fiery glow,
like trimmed poles. Henry finally managed to distinguish
the village he was taking us to, but it was
dead and deserted. The lava was all-destructive.
We could get no closer than a mile to the shore, and
then steamed on up the coast, hoping to find some
place that had not been seared by the fires. We would
get nearly to the shore, only to see a reeking stream of
lava, further back and creeping down to the sea. Then
on we would go again. Everyone else in the boat
was awestruck by such wholesale destruction; they were
leaning over the rail in wonder, without any idea of the
possibility of the engine's stopping, but my heart was
in my mouth all the time, for the wind had dropped,
and had the engines ever stopped, it would have been
all up with us—nothing could have kept us away
from those cascades of lava. But luck was certainly
with us. The engine ran smoothly, and as the first
streaks of day lighted the east, we sighted a village <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>p255</span>
that was unharmed and showing signs of human occupation.
Henry pronounced this place to be Matautu,
and we decided to anchor. After things were safely
stowed, everyone went to sleep on deck, after a hard
night's work.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon before anyone awoke.
As we felt like going ashore after our rest, Jack and
Mrs. London and myself set out in the launch. We
came to a deserted beach. There were no natives in
sight, although we could hear the hum of voices back
in the village. As the beach ran out so far in a
gradual slope, we were forced to anchor the launch
out several hundred yards, and wade ashore. We
walked up the beach to the village, whence we had
heard the voices, and found several hundred natives before
a small church, all praying that the lava would not
come down and destroy their village. Two young
girls in the centre of the group were dressed in gala
array of feathers and tapa cloths of gay colours, and
each was carrying an ornamental club. They simply
stood in the centre, taking no part in the ceremonies.
They were the first to see us, and quietly motioning to
the assembly, spoke a few words. The crowd dispersed,
all going away talking in quiet tones, but even
if we could not understand, it was easy to guess that
they were still supplicating for the eruption to cease;
and their quiet manner left no doubt that they had supreme
confidence in the potency of prayer.</p>

<p>The two girls who had first sighted us were called, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>p256</span>
in the Samoan language, <i>taupou</i> girls. Each village
in Samoa has its <i>taupou</i> girl, only one to the village,
who upholds the honour of that village, entertains the
guests, and otherwise makes herself agreeable. She
controls the feasts and functions, and in fact has more
power than anyone, excepting the chief. As she is
really the most virtuous woman in the village, she is
made the highest dignitary at all religious gatherings,
although taking no part in them.</p>

<p>All the villages for twenty miles up the coast had
been destroyed and the people had fled to Matautu.
There were about twenty <i>taupou</i> girls gathered here.
As Jack said, they looked like girls out of a job, for
when they leave their own village, they lose power.
Certainly they had not shown much power in letting
the lava destroy their homes. Only the Matautu
<i>taupou</i> girls seemed to be still in favour. These girls
attached themselves to Mrs. London and showed us
over the village. But such a woe-begone village!
On all sides the red-hot lava was creeping down, though
they had managed to divert the flow by building stone
walls; but they knew that unless the volcano twenty-five
miles away quieted down, their homes were
doomed. It was dark when we prepared to go back
to the <i>Snark</i>. We were stopped just as we got to
the launch by a white man, calling to us on the beach.
We went back and found a big, jolly Irishman, waiting
for us in company with a tall German.</p>

<span class="caption">At Otivi Village, Santa Cruz Group
 <a class="imglst" href="#ILLUSTRATIONS">Imglst</a></span>
</div>

<p>The Irishman was Dick Williams, the governor of <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>p257</span>
the island, and the German was the agent of an Apia
trading concern. We went back with the governor to
his house, and learned that he had been away all day
helping the volcano sufferers. He invited us to stay
ashore all night, promising to show us a better view of
the eruption the next day. So, after a crowd of
Kanakas had carried the launch up on the beach, we
went to nicely furnished grass houses that the governor
owned, and next morning, after a bath on the beach,
we started for the lava flows with the two white
men as guides. We walked miles between two
flows of lava—hot lava that scorched our hair. At
one place, we passed the frame of a grass house
set between the walls of an old church. The owner
had thought that on account of its being near a church
of God it would not be ruined, and his goods would be
safe. We walked over beds of lava that had cooled
for several days and that, encrusted, would bear our
weight; but we knew what lay beneath, for here and
there, where there were fissures in the cooled crust,
spits of steam and bubbling jets of lava flowed outward
into the air. At one place, we found a remarkable
thing—a small churchyard that had been unmolested
by the flow. It looked as if the stream had
parted and gone around the graveyard and joined into
one stream after the place had been passed. We went
on farther to a fresh lava stream that had just broken
out. Close by was a large frame house, the home of
the former governor of Savaii, now deserted. Here a <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>p258</span>
mass of lava, about three feet in thickness and several
hundred yards wide, was slowly coming toward the
house; red and glowing, it was advancing about an
inch a minute. With long sticks we gathered the lava
and pressed coins into it, to keep for souvenirs. As
we returned by way of the church graveyard, we stood
in the plot marvelling at such a miracle—that the
molten destruction had parted at this burial place!—and
we ceased to look upon the Kanaka who had
built his house inside the churchyard as a joke: he had
sufficient reason, after seeing the graveyard saved, to
believe that his own home would be preserved.</p>

<p>As we came to the edge of the village, we skirted
a fresh flow of lava, creeping up on a church. Inside
the place were crowds of natives, all praying at once
that the church be saved. They were coughing and
wiping their eyes from the effects of the sulphur fumes
that were enveloping them. We stood and watched
this sad sight. Soon the people filed out, slowly, forlornly,
and we stood by to see the end. In half an
hour the first of the lava struck the building, and soon
was running in the doors, setting fire to everything
inflammable. Next morning when I looked for the
church I found only a mass of ruins.</p>

<p>We lived ashore five days, and on the last day I
rode nearly twenty-five miles, trying to reach the leeward
side of the crater, but the barefoot native guide
turned back after it grew too hot for his unprotected
flesh, and I got only to within half a mile of the crater, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>p259</span>
but near enough to see the awful yawning hole, nearly
a mile across, emitting thousands and thousands of tons
of liquid death every minute. I sat on the charred
log of a cocoanut tree and wondered where it all came
from. Certainly, wherever it was formed, there was
no dearth of material. I afterward saw many volcanoes,
but none of them had the impressive magnificence
of this.</p>

<p>We left the harbour in the afternoon of the fifth
day; our two <i>taupou</i>-girl friends came aboard to say
good-bye, and as we looked over to their village and
asked them to tell good-bye to our friends ashore whom
we had not been able to see, they turned their eyes
shoreward and burst into tears, for already a narrow
stream of lava had broken through their village, and it
would be only a matter of a few days when they would
be living in another village, shorn of power, and their
own pretty homes would be in ashes under the lava.</p>

<p>So it was that we up-anchored and set out for the
Fijis, where we were to lose our last and final captain.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a>p260</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI<br />
LOST IN THE FIJI ISLANDS</h2>
<p class="toclink"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></p>
<p>From the Samoan Islands to the Fijis, the distance is
nine hundred miles. After we had cleared the Samoan
Islands, we ran along under power for several hours;
then the sails were set, and by sun-down we were speeding
along under an eight-knot wind, which grew
stronger and stronger, until by midnight all hands
were on deck taking in the headsails and reefing the
mainsails. By morning we were in the grip of a summer
gale, but luckily for us it was in the right direction,
and with only a double-reefed staysail and a triple-reefed
mizzen, we plunged along at about twelve knots
an hour. Big waves, looking as large as a courthouse,
would come roaring up to us, and the little <i>Snark</i>
would rise on the side and hover over the dizzy
depths of watery valleys—then down we would go
with that queer sensation that one experiences in riding
on a swift elevator, feeling as if we were falling
out from under ourselves; and sometimes two waves
would come so close together that the second one would
break against the side of the <i>Snark</i> with such force
as to throw everyone off his feet, and whoever was
steering could only save himself by hugging the wheel.
At such times as this, it was difficult to steer. For it
is not just a matter of pointing a ship the way you want <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a>p261</span>
to go and then keeping the wheel geared that way, but
it is a matter of watching a big wave and then easing
up into it to keep from being broken into splinters;
and the sails must be watched every second, for should
the wind ever get behind them, they would swing across
deck with such force as to drag the masts out of the
ship, and everything on deck would be carried away.
It looks easy enough to steer a ship, but it takes a
person six months to get experience enough in it to be
trusted alone at the wheel.</p>

<p>For three days we ran along in the teeth of the gale.
Everything on deck that had not been made fast was
carried away. The small boats had been taken in
from the davits and lashed upside down on the deck.
No fire could be made in the galley, so we lived mostly
on hardtack. Everything above and below was saturated
with salt water. In the afternoon of the third
day, the squall broke as quickly as it had formed,
leaving us rolling on a glassy-smooth sea. The wind
dropped nearly calm and the mists cleared away, so
that we could see the horizon. It is well known how
clear the air gets after a storm. Well, we were so
tired that we were for turning into our bunks, until
Henry cried, "Reef ahead!" and on going into the
rigging, I saw reef on all sides of us. Immediately,
the sails were backed, and we hove-to. I started the
engines; then, for the rest of the day, we went round
and round the inside of the lagoon, trying to find the
place we had gotten in at. It looked as if we were <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a>p262</span>
lost. Each effort puzzled us only the more. All night
we kept up the attempt to find the passage, but it was
not until morning that we found it, a gap in the reef
about two hundred feet wide. And there were twenty-five
miles of reef we might easily have struck on!
How we ever got into the place is a mystery, and remains
a mystery to this day.</p>

<p>There was not an island in sight. It was nearly
sun-down when we did sight several small islands, and
after threading in and out of countless reefs, we managed
to get penned up in another lagoon, where we lay-to
for the night. Next day was a repetition of the one
before. So also was the next. For several days we
dodged in and out of reefs and around small islands,
charted as the Ringgold Islands. At times we were
in despair. To find the concealed openings in the reef
was like looking for the proverbial needle in the haystack.
On the eighth day we sighted clear water
ahead, and slipping out between two of the largest
islands, Vanua Levu and Taviuni, we slid into the
Koro Sea, which is the name of the two hundred miles
of water that is made into a lagoon by hundreds of
small islands circling around it. Only one small island
is inside this sea, and Jack had decided to go up along
the shores of this island and have a look at the villages.
We were perhaps five miles off the land when a small
cutter put out, and heading toward us, would have
passed our bow, but the helmsman swerved around and
passed close enough to speak. He was a woolly-headed <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>p263</span>
Fiji-Islander. His shouting awoke a white man who
was asleep below. On coming on deck, the white man
rubbed his eyes and sleepily asked: "What ship is
that?" We replied: "<i>Snark</i>, San Francisco."
Then he yelled: "Is that Jack London's boat?"
We told him it was. "Heave-to, I'm coming aboard,"
he cried; and as we were in no hurry to get anywhere,
we hove-to, and he came about and also hove-to.
Then, in a little dingy, he was rowed to the <i>Snark</i>,
and he just fell all over himself with joy. "And
to think that I should ever see Jack London, and on
his own boat, too! Why, I have every one of your
books aboard my ship, and all your magazine articles.
But, pshaw! the boys won't believe I ever saw Jack
London." And he nearly cried, he was so happy.</p>

<p>Frank Whitcomb had been trading nearly all his
life in the Fiji Islands, and Jack London's books had
been about all he had read. I believe that in his eyes
Jack was the greatest man that ever lived.</p>

<p>He loaded us down with fresh fruits and onions and
potatoes. In return, we gave him several bottles of
wine. And the last thing that long, lanky Frank Whitcomb
said as he was rowed away from the <i>Snark</i> was:
"And to think that I should live to shake hands with
Jack London, and on his own boat, too!" Whitcomb
was the only man who ever boarded the <i>Snark</i> at sea.</p>

<p>As we sailed past the solitary island in the Koro
Sea, several boats tried to put off to us, but we were in
a hurry, and so did not wait for them to get over the <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a>p264</span>
reef, but sailed on until by night we were again among
small islands and were forced to heave-to until morning.</p>

<p>From the time we had left Samoan waters, it was
Jack who always located our true position on the chart.
Jack told me that if he must do the navigating, he could
and would do it and would not be bothered with anyone
else. So everyone on board suspected that Captain
Y—— was to be discharged at Suva, Fiji. The captain
had gotten angry at Wada and had broken his
nose, and had it not been for Mrs. London, I think he
would have laid Nakata out, so no one was sorry that
we were to be rid of him.</p>

<p>The next morning after our meeting with Frank
Whitcomb, we set sail, after being hove-to all night,
and passed all sorts of queer crafts, most of them of
bamboo, and soon were threading in and out of countless
little green islands, going so close sometimes that
we could plainly make out villages. Now and then
canoes would put off to us. At one place, we went
close enough to shore to see people plainly; they ran
down to the beach, shouting at us. We passed many
strange raft-like crafts, made of split bamboo. On
some of the crafts we could see whole families, who
stared at us in wonder as we slid past. These vessels
were in some cases loaded with fruits and sandalwood
and copra. I saw several of the same crafts come into
Suva Harbor again after a week's journey at sea. The <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>p265</span>
natives have no fear, and will sometimes live for
months on their queer floats without stepping ashore.</p>

<p>Henry was not slow in taking advantage of the
smooth water, and supplied our table with different
kinds of fish every day; in fact, we always fished in
preference to everything else. While calmed or anchored,
he caught many a shark without hook or line,
by the old Kanaka method of spearing them while they
lie asleep on the bottom in shallow water.</p>

<p>It was nearly ten days after we had been tangled up
in the Fiji Islands when we sighted the large island
of Viti Levu, and turned the <i>Snark's</i> bow into another
of the South Seas' famous ports. Suva, Fiji, looms
up from the sea, quite like a modern city, and is really
the most modern in this part of the world. Nearly
half of its eight thousand persons are of white blood;
and Suva is also chief station of the Pacific commercial
cables. Several modern hotels and large headquarters
for the trading concerns are to be found here.</p>

<p>Fiji is also the headquarters for the British commissioners
of the whole of the South Sea possessions,
and here is located the British penal settlement. Prisoners
are sent here from all the English possessions
in the South Seas.</p>

<p>We dropped anchor under supervision of Captain
Wooley, the harbour inspector, and by nightfall Jack
and Mrs. London were installed at Mrs. McDonald's
hotel, the most famous hotel in Oceania.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>p266</span></p>

<p>Directly we had dropped anchor, Captain Y——
went ashore, and walking up and down the streets of
Suva, he <em>would</em> have everyone know that Captain
Y—— of the <i>Snark</i> was in town. His boasting led
him from saloon to saloon; and soon he was so drunk
that he could hardly walk. I left him telling of his
sea-experiences to a bunch of bar-flies, and went to the
hotel and had late dinner with the Londons. Captain
Y—— did not come aboard that night. Next
morning, when Jack arrived, he asked me to pack all of
Y—— 's possessions and take them ashore; also, he
instructed us not to allow the captain to come aboard
again. I had taken Captain Y—— 's clothing ashore
and was making the rounds of stores, buying clothes
that I had had no chance to get since leaving Honolulu.
In my absence, Captain Y—— had gone aboard the
<i>Snark</i>, and was showing the yacht to the captain of a
big six-masted schooner. He ordered Nakata to
bring drinks on deck, but Nakata refused, telling him
that Mr. London had said he was discharged. Poor
Captain Y—— must have felt very cheap in company
with his old captain-friend, but he left the <i>Snark</i>
without making a fuss, and a few days later sailed
away on the six-master as an ordinary seaman—quite
a come-down, from skipper of a smart yacht to the
lowest position on a windjammer.</p>

<p>While Suva was very modern for a South Sea city,
one had only to go a few miles into the interior of the
island to find primitive life. I was lucky enough to <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>p267</span>
get in with a party on an excursion trip across the bay
and up several small streams, and spent several days
among the mango swamps, seeing strange people.
We had a party of Fiji prisoners to row our boat, and
we went miles and miles through a dense forest of
tropical trees. Every now and then, some native in
his little canoe would stop to look at us in wonder.</p>

<p>Once a native reporter on the <i>Fiji Times</i>—his
English name was George Dyer—took me over to
his island to attend church. The natives all gathered
in a little wooden building and squatted on a bare
floor in front of the preacher, a big, bushy-haired man,
who preached after the style of some of our old-fashioned
exhorters. The parishioners wore nothing but
loin-cloths and their wonderful mops of hair.</p>

<p>There was an intermission, which I misconstrued into
dismissal of services and went outside to sit on a big
hollow log that came handy. Pretty soon the pastor
came out and tapped me on the shoulder. I could not
make out what he wanted, so asked George. "He
wants you," replied the boy, "to get off the log so
that he can ring the bell." It developed that the
preacher hammered on the log to call the congregation
together, and I was unwittingly muffling the call of the
Gospel.</p>

<p>Arriving back in Suva, I was kept busy getting the
<i>Snark</i> in shape for another long voyage, doing the
work that Captain Y—— had done as well as my own.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII<br />
SOUTH SEA CANNIBALS</h2>
<p class="toclink"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></p>
<p>Everyone has heard of the wild and savage cannibals
of the South Sea islands, and to the average mind,
either the whole of the South Pacific is inhabited by
man-eaters, or the idea that such bloodthirsty creatures
exist is simply scoffed at.</p>

<p>Hitherto I have told of the gentle, big, brown inhabitants
of the eastern islands, known as Polynesia.
But now we have come into Melanesia. Let me try to
describe, as modestly yet graphically as possible, the
first of the Melanesians that the <i>Snark</i> crew came in
contact with.</p>

<p>It is hard to tell of these savages. Yet, in writing
of them, I simply state facts. These people exist.
There are at this time some seventy thousand of them
in the New Hebrides Islands. Very few white people
have ever seen them. They can scarcely be written
about in language sufficiently plain to give a definite
idea of them. The hundred or more pictures I made
of these cannibals cannot be printed in a volume intended
for popular circulation.</p>

<p>Probably it is best to describe these people as one
would describe animals. For they are only one degree
removed from the animals. I wish I might speak
plainly. But a great deal of the modesty in our ultra-civilised <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>p269</span>
state is a false modesty, inasmuch as it is
not based upon necessity. It is this fact that constitutes
the difficulty when one attempts to describe a race living
in absolute savagery, unwitting of those rules of conduct
we have laid down for our guidance, a race whose
social relations are vastly different from ours. This
much, however, I must say. Our so-called "proper"
clothing is in many cases designed solely for purposes
of suggestion. Men and women who go stark naked
every day of their lives are oftentimes more moral and
have stronger natural modesty than certain of those
who bedizen themselves with fashionable silks and
satins.</p>

<p>In my studies of various peoples as I have journeyed
round this earth, I have found many queer customs and
fashions. In some countries, they squeeze the foot
to make it small, and a woman with a large foot is a
social outcast. In other countries they cover parts of
the face. An Arabian woman would expose her entire
body in order to keep the lower part of her face
hidden. The Chinese men, as a sign of rank and
distinction, develop long finger-nails, and we can well
remember when our own women wore ridiculously
large bustles that looked very funny on the street.
By the way, speaking of bustles, I wish to say that the
habit of wearing them did not originate in any of the
fashion-centres. Bustles have always been and now are
the only article of apparel worn by the women of the
New Hebrides. And funny as these women look with <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a>p270</span>
only large plaited grass bustles on them, we must not
consider them foolish, for they have just as much right
to their fashions as the women of America, England,
France, Germany, or any other civilised country, have
to theirs.</p>

<p>Having seen all these fashions, I am willing to
grant to men or women the perfect liberty to dress or
adorn themselves, or go undressed, as they see fit.
Having, as I believe, seen the origin of the bustle
among these primitive folk, I fully expect to see some
day the prettiest ladies of our land wearing enormous
nose-rings, as there are places in the world where such
nose-rings constitute the entire wardrobe.</p>

<p>Ignorance is not virtue. Virtue is knowledge
coupled with self-restraint. And so let me call attention
to a people who are as directly opposed to us in
their views of morality as could be imagined. These
people are sex worshippers, and their ideas of right
and wrong lead them to call attention to the very
subjects we seek to hide and dismiss from our minds.</p>

<p>To go back to Suva, Fiji. Captain Warren was no
longer a member of the <i>Snark's</i> crew. As we lay
alongside the wharf at Suva, the crew painted and
scraped masts, decks and booms, and after loading
with water and provisions, we were again ready for
sea. Tehei was dressed in his first suit of clothes,
of which he was as proud as a peacock. Our compasses
were swung and adjusted by an expert. Our
chronometer was taken aboard an Australian steamer <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>p271</span>
and corrected, and we were ready to try our luck with
Captain Jack London. And when I think of the crew
of the <i>Snark</i>, I always think of the crew that sailed
out of Fiji, and the same crew that stuck to the trip to
the end. Up to this time, I had seen come and go
three captains, two engineers, several sailors and a
cabin-boy. The crew that sailed from Suva included
Mr. and Mrs. London, myself, and four dark-skinned
persons: Nakata, the Jap cabin-boy, Wada San, the
Jap cook, and the two Tahitians, Tehei and Henry.</p>

<p>We cleared Suva Harbor at 12:30 on the afternoon
of Saturday, June 6, 1908. The harbour master, with
his crew of Fiji convicts, was the last to leave; then
we just slid out of the bay with a strong beam wind,
and in an hour had left Suva out of sight. We passed
a small cutter, and her crew of bushy-haired Fijians
cried good-bye in their own language, and dipped their
flag. About four o'clock we got to the entrance of a
very narrow channel and between two small islands.
I took the wheel, and Jack sang out the course from the
bow. By six o'clock we were through and headed for
the open sea, at which everyone was glad, for reefs and
small islands cause much worry.</p>

<p>The next day I cleaned up the engine room and did
small carpentering jobs about the ship. The sea was
quite rough, and we had the skylights battened down;
but because of the clearness of the sky we did not expect
very nasty weather. We were speeding at about
seven knots. All day, Jack studied navigation. For <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a>p272</span>
the first several days out of Fiji he had no time to write.
He navigated by every method known to captains, and
then proved his navigating as we used to prove our
arithmetic problems at school. On Wednesday morning,
I took the time while he got the sight; then we
corrected the two compasses, he watching one compass
and I the other. Jack figured that day that we had
done ten thousand miles in the <i>Snark</i> since leaving San
Francisco.</p>

<p>That evening, Jack announced that at a certain point
on the compass, at sunrise next morning, would be the
first island in the New Hebrides, called Futuna, and
next morning at five o'clock there was a call for all
hands on deck. I hurried up, expecting to see a storm
closing in on us, but instead the sky was clear and Jack
was excitedly pointing to a rocky island at the exact
place he had told us of the night before. Jack said:
"I told you so," and for the rest of that day he went
around with his head up in the air, with the bearing
of a person who knew much more than any others on
board, and we all looked at him in awe and told him he
was a great navigator.</p>

<p>Futuna was a high, flat rock, as seen from the sea.
We did not go close enough to examine it. We had a
good breeze, and all that day we passed small uninhabited
islands, and that night slowed down, for the
island of Tanna was directly ahead, and we were afraid
to go into the bay at night; but early next morning we <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>p273</span>
dropped anchor opposite a mission station in a long,
narrow bay.</p>

<p>The third cylinder igniters blew out when I tried
to use the engine to help us into this bay, and we had
trouble in finding an entrance, for the place seemed
reef-locked, but we took a chance, and finally got in.
We anchored one hundred yards off a high bluff,
on the top of which was a little white church, almost
hidden by the dense jungle. We saw clumsy canoes
coming toward us, and soon two hundred of the puniest,
dirtiest, most unhealthy little thieving natives
came aboard. All afternoon they kept arriving in canoe-loads.
All wore remnants of white men's clothing,
filthy beyond description. Some had only an undershirt;
some, old trousers; and there were old hats
of all kinds. One carried an umbrella. Others,
again, wore red singlets, so full of holes they would
scarcely hang on their backs. Their ears were
pierced with holes I could have stuck my thumb
through. They were all missionaries from the mission
school on the top of the hill—and great missionaries
they were! In the afternoon, when we three
whites started ashore, we cleared the deck of the natives,
and they cleared the deck of any spare ropes
or marlin they could find loose. We missed nearly
everything that was small enough for the natives to
get away with. We went ashore and had dinner with
the only missionary on the island, Rev. Watt. He <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a>p274</span>
had been for twenty-eight years at this station, and
had managed to convert the coast natives only, but in
the interior the natives were as savage and primitive
as the day God had made them—he sighed when he
told us of the interior natives. We asked him to take
us on an excursion to see these natives, but he flung
up his hands in horror. "No! It was no place for a
woman," and we could not persuade him to alter his
decision. He told us of a lawless trader living on
the island, and for us to be careful of him, he was
a very bad man; he was friendly with the bush natives.
And right then Jack whispered to me that we must
find that bad, wicked trader and get him to take us
to visit the savages that we had sailed thousands and
thousands of miles to see. On going aboard that night,
we found the wicked trader sitting on our deck, smoking
Jack's cigarettes. He was a big, jolly-looking
Scotchman. He was overjoyed to see us, for it is
mighty few white people that Trader Wiley ever sees
in Tanna. He had been trading here for over seven
years. In order to trade among the different tribes,
he had learned their languages, and to gain their friendship
had doctored the sick and set broken bones. He
had been the means of bringing peace between several
of the tribes that before his advent had been continually
at war. But the missionary considered him a bad
man because he had gained such a hold on the natives,
and, doctoring their ills and injuries, refused to doctor
their souls.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>p275</span></p>

<p>Mr. Wiley stayed for supper, and told us some interesting
yarns of the island. Up to one year ago, the
different tribes were at war with each other. No
tribe dared go outside its own boundaries, unless it
wished to precipitate a rumpus. But the English warship
<i>Cambrian</i> came and threw bombs in some of the
villages, and now the natives were quiet through
fear of having their homes destroyed. It had been
three years, Mr. Wiley said, since a cannibalistic feast
took place, and he had been there to see it. Having
the confidence of the natives because he smuggled old-fashioned
"Springfield" rifles in to them, he was allowed
to go and come as he pleased. He had gone
up into the bush after copra one day, after one tribe
had been defeated by the tribe he was visiting, and
was asked to stay and watch the feast that night,
which he did—he found four bodies cooked and
ready to eat, with the heads off and the bowels removed.</p>

<p>Of course he would show us the bush people; but he
warned us that they were not the kind of people that
we had been used to. It was agreed that on Sunday,
June 22, he was to take us up to the village where he
had seen the cannibal feast. On Saturday, Jack and
Mrs. London went to see one of the most noted volcanoes
in the New Hebrides, which is located on this
island. I wandered up and down the bay, looking in
the village huts and trying to find curios, but the natives
seemed to have none. One little four-foot grass hut <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a>p276</span>
and a few dirty mats is all the average man here possesses.</p>

<p>I gossiped with Mr. Wiley and his partner, Mr.
Stanton, in their little 10-x-15 store, where they ate,
slept and traded. Very little money was in circulation;
they traded out of their stock for copra. One stick
of cheap tobacco bought ten cocoanuts; and three sticks
would hire a man for one day to take the meat from
the nut and dry it into copra; so it will be seen that
the remuneration of labour in the New Hebrides is
nothing magnificent. One stick of tobacco is worth
a cent.</p>

<p>Saturday night, Jack, Mrs. London and I took supper
with Rev. Watt. The missionary was a fairly decent
sort of man, but I don't approve of his methods. In
the evening, I developed film in his dark-room.</p>

<p>Early Sunday morning, Tehei landed us on the beach,
where we found Frank Stanton waiting for us. He
explained that Mr. Wiley was sick and could not go.
We four started off, and for several hours tramped
over hills and through valleys, penetrating a jungle
of trees and vines and ferns so dense that in places
we walked through pitch-dark recesses, into which the
sun had never shone. Sometimes we rested under a
big banyan tree, with its hundreds of roots and its
branches turning and growing back into the ground
until the single tree might cover as much as a half
acre. We passed several of Mr. Stanton's copra
houses, where he came on certain days each week to <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a>p277</span>
buy cocoanuts; then we struck off through a deep ravine,
the walls forty and fifty feet high, with just enough
room for us to walk single-file. All the time, we were
gradually rising higher and higher above the sea-level.
Often we had to pull Mrs. London up after us,
but she was game and never lagged a bit. About
one o'clock we emerged without warning into a clearing
set on the side of a mountain, a clearing about
a half-mile across. Many grass houses were set in a
circle around this clearing. In the centre of the circle
squatted about fifty men, as many children, and a few
women. They were the most savage, heathenish looking
folk I have ever looked upon. I had heard of and
seen pictures of such savages, but I had hardly been
able to convince myself that such animals existed: but
here was ocular demonstration. They were smeared
over their bodies with coloured juices from berries,
and several of the younger men had queer white designs
painted on their faces. The men wore belts
around their waists—that was all; around their ankles
were anklets of porpoise shell or cocoanut shell, and
there were some that were carved of stone. Many
wore strings of white shells around their necks.
Through their enormously distended ear-lobes were
thrust pieces of wood as big as one's wrist, or ear-rings
of porpoise shell. But the crowning beauty was their
heads. The hair, dyed red, was about a foot long.
Locks of about one hundred hairs were wrapped from
the roots to within one inch of the end with cocoanut <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a>p278</span>
fibre; and the whole head was one cluster of these
bunches. And every man carried a large knife. As
for the women, they wore a dried palm-leaf hung on
in front by a string around the waist; except for a miscellaneous
collection of anklets, bracelets, and necklets,
this was all they wore.</p>

<p>Most of these savages broke for the bush when
they sighted us; all but fifteen or twenty who knew
Mr. Stanton well. Stanton spoke to them; they advanced
with hands outstretched; and we shook hands
all around.</p>

<p>"How can I describe these people in my diary?"
Mrs. London asked.</p>

<p>"'Worse than naked,' and let it go at that," Jack
replied.</p>

<p>And so, in turn, I can describe these people at no
greater length and no better than to say, as Jack said,
that they were worse than naked. For several hours
we sat with them in the clearing, and showed how Mrs.
London's Winchester could shoot eleven times in the
twinkling of an eye. I made dozens of photographs,
and tried to photograph the women; but they were
very shy. I got only one, as she was diving into her
house.</p>

<p>The men who had run for the bush we could see on
all sides of us, peeping around trees and through the
dense brush at the edges of the jungle. They were
armed with spears, so we kept our hands on our guns all
the time, but Stanton assured us they were not dangerous. <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a>p279</span>
Nevertheless, we were not going to take any
risks.</p>

</div>

<p>Late that afternoon, we started back for the bush.
For some time we could see painted faces peeking at
us through the jungle. When we arrived on board
the <i>Snark</i> late that night, I gave a big sigh of relief.
I had been far from comfortable among these ferocious-looking
bush people.</p>

<p>I desired very much to develop my film that night,
but Rev. Watt refused to let me use his dark-room.
"Christians should do nothing at all on the Sabbath!"
he told me; and I gathered from his tones that he
knew of our expedition inland, and that he was far
from approving of it.</p>

<p>The New Hebrides are entirely of volcanic origin.
There are about thirty active volcanoes in the group,
of which the greatest is on the island of Tanna. At
night the sky is fiery red from the reflection of the red-hot
lava in its crater, and about every half hour the
air is rent with a terrific explosion, and from the direction
of the volcano the sky seems afire.</p>

<p>On the morning after we had visited the bush people,
Henry, Tehei, Nakata and myself secured guides
and went to the volcano, walking for miles through
barren desert land, hundreds of hot springs and geysers
on all sides of us. As we drew closer, the ground under
our feet would tremble with each explosion. At
noon we reached the edge of the crater. Just as we
got there, there came a tremendous explosion, and away <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a>p280</span>
we ran, guides and all. When we recovered our courage,
we crept up to the edge, and looked down nearly
half a mile into what looked like hell. Out of the
bowels of the earth were thrown huge boulders, which
spent their force and fell back with hideous reverberations
into the pits whence they came; and away at
the bottom, the farthest down I have ever seen—and
I believe it is the bottom-most point to which one
can see—were two boiling lakes of lava, and when
an explosion came, the lava would be thrown spattering
against the encrusted crater sides, nearly to the top,
and then run in thousands of rivers of liquid fire back
to the bottom. The rumblings and explosions were
deafening. I had to leave the edge of the crater, for
there was stealing over me the overwhelming desire
to jump off and to the bottom of the twin lakes of
molten death—a desire that everyone has experienced
when looking down from a vast elevation.</p>

<p>We got back to the bay about two o'clock that afternoon,
where we found that a whole village of bush-boys
had come down to buy tobacco. There were
about fifty of them, all naked, and they had brought
bows and arrows and spears. I gave a shilling, a brass
ring, and a red handkerchief for a bow and two arrows,
then invited the crowd aboard, for I knew Jack
would want some of their bows and spears, and I myself
wanted to get some good photographs of these
natives. I took a few of them over in the launch, and
the rest came in canoes, until we could scarcely move <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a>p281</span>
around on deck. Jack snapped twenty good exposures
of them, and I, too, got busy with my cameras. Then
began the trading, which lasted for over an hour.
Many a bow, spear, and pack of arrows shifted hands
that afternoon, in exchange for tobacco, cheap jewellery,
candy and red cloth. Jack boxed up his things and
sent them back to California, while I boxed mine and
sent them to Independence.</p>

<p>We lay at Tanna a week. Then, at four o'clock on
a fine Tuesday afternoon, we motored out of the
harbour and slid twenty miles up the coast, until we
got out from under the lee of the land and caught a
light breeze. All the next day we sailed to windward
of Erromango, heaving-to at night for fear of running
into land in the dark, and early the next morning putting
on sail and heading for land twenty miles away.</p>

<p>As we were cruising in a general westerly direction
through the New Hebrides, a little incident occurred
which throws a side-light on the man, Jack London.
One day, when weather conditions were perfect and
everyone was on deck enjoying himself, an animated
ball of variegated colours dropped slowly down into
the cockpit at the feet of Mrs. London, who was at the
wheel. She eagerly picked it up, calling out, "Lookie,
lookie, what I've got!" It proved to be the prettiest
little bird we had ever seen. Jack got out his book
on ornithology, and proceeded to study book and bird,
but nowhere was such a bird described.</p>

<p>It was evidently a land-bird that had gotten too far <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a>p282</span>
from shore and had fallen exhausted on the deck of
the <i>Snark</i>. We all stood around looking at it as it
lay in Mrs. London's hand, while she chirped and tried
to talk bird-talk to it. At last Jack said: "If it's a
land-bird you are, to the land you go," and changing
the course, we sailed for the island Mallicollo, just
barely visible ten miles out of our way. We sailed
as close to the shore as possible, and the little multi-coloured,
pigeon-like bird, having regained its strength,
flew in among the cocoanut trees. Then we headed
out and continued our cruise up through the score of
small islands composing the Western New Hebrides.</p>

<p>Critics of the man, Jack London, may call him an
infidel. Colonel Roosevelt may call him a "nature
faker." Others have not agreed with his ideas of
life, but I have little doubt that this is the only time
a captain ever went twenty miles out of his way when
his fuel was low (our gasolene tanks were fast emptying),
just to put a poor little bird ashore to go back
to its mate and its young.</p>

<p>On our way through these islands we lived entirely
on deck, so as to miss none of the beautiful scenery.
The weather continued equable. We rode the water
as silently as a canoe. The islands around us sheltered
the sea from any disturbances, leaving the surface
of these island straits perfectly calm. We sailed
a day and a night past a score of active volcanoes.
One towering cone of land protruded from the water
like an enormous ant-hill, smoke wreathing the top in <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a>p283</span>
the day, and the fiery red craters acting as lighthouses
by night. Once we put into Vila, anchoring between
two small schooners in the bay. Vila has only a few
white people, traders and some governmental officials.
And here is a queer government. These islands are
owned jointly by France and England; one governor
will make a law, then the other governor will make a
law directly opposed. It is all a joke among the
traders. The schooners we saw were <i>blackbirders</i>,
which made a practice of going to other islands and
capturing natives, to be sold in the labour markets of
Fiji and Samoa. When I think of this practice, I do
not really wonder that the natives are so savage against
the whites. As we came into this port, the French
flags were at half-mast for a captain that had been
killed in another island while trying to get labour.</p>

<p>It was now decided that the <i>Snark</i> must be getting
on faster, in order that we might pass through the
Indian Ocean before the typhoon season. We went
by the last of the New Hebrides and next day cruised
past the Banks Islands, but did not linger. For
another day we sailed past the Santa Cruz Islands.
Then for three days we slid through an open sea.</p>

<p>In my diary, kept during this part of the trip, I find
some interesting entries.</p>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Monday, June 22, 1908.</h3>—To-day we are about
five miles off the last of the New Hebrides. It is a
big volcanic island, five thousand five hundred feet
high. We have only a three-knot breeze and the sea <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a>p284</span>
is as smooth as I ever saw it. We have the awning
under the mizzensail amidships, where Jack and Mrs.
London are lying on their cots reading. Also, the
awning is set over the cockpit. The sun is shining
brightly, without a cloud in the sky. Henry, Wada
and Nakata are asleep in the life-boat; and Tehei is at
the wheel—nearly asleep, too. I've been reading
nearly all day, and as soon as my work is through I'm
going to crawl into the launch and go to sleep.</div>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Tuesday, June 23, 1908.</h3>—Last night late we
sighted an island of the Banks group. The stars shone
so brightly that it was very plain twenty miles away.
To-day the breeze has freshened, and the sea is pretty
rough—so rough that one big wave came over the
deck and down my open skylight, drenching me as I
was painting my big engine, so that I have had to batten
down and quit work in the engine room. Tehei
caught several large bonita on his pearl-hook, so that
we have plenty of fish on our table. No one will eat
cooked fish now, for we have at last learned to eat it
raw. The fish is cut in strips, soaked one hour in
salt water and lime-juice, then eaten in a sauce of lime-juice
and olive oil. For a long time I could not
stomach this delicacy, but now I find it very good.
The Kanakas do not even wait for the salt water, but
cut strips off the fish while it is still struggling on deck.</div>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Wednesday, June 24, 1908.</h3>—Every day, Jack gives
me a lesson in navigation, and I in turn give Henry a
lesson. Last night, as we three were playing cards, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a>p285</span>
Jack gave a yell and pointed to Mrs. London's bunk,
from which a centipede six inches long was crawling.
And Henry says he has seen several on deck. Not
very pleasant companions! But our worst enemies are
the cockroaches—millions of them. When I am in
my bunk and they crawl over me I don't even bother
to brush them off; but, of course, we have to skim
them from our coffee and chase them out of the food.</div>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Friday, June 26, 1908.</h3>—A wild and woolly night.
Lightning and thunder everywhere. We are hove-to,
for Jack says that land is not more than twenty-five
miles off in some direction, but we don't know which,
for it has been hazy all day. It's dark as pitch, except
when a flash of lightning shows several serious faces on
deck. Wonder what next! Last night we hove-to,
but it was fine weather and we three played cards during
my watch. To-night we tried it, but we could
not keep our minds on the game with such a furious
sky overhead. In Kansas, I would say a cyclone was
nearly on us, but here in the South Seas I don't think
it can be less than a hurricane. I am in the cockpit
watching the wheel, although we are not moving; but
should a current start us west, I must set the sails to
put us in another direction, and that very slow!</div>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Saturday, June 27, 1908.</h3>—This has been an awful
day for me, and I'm dead tired but not sleepy. Again
we are hove-to, in about the same position as last night,
only we now know where we are. About fifteen miles
ahead is a low wooded island, and away back of it the <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a>p286</span>
lofty peaks of several islands of the Solomons—the
darkest and least-known islands in the world.</div>

<p>They were discovered by Henry at daybreak this
morning; and immediately Jack told me to start the
engines, for it was dead calm. I did so, and No. 1
insulation plug on the igniters blew out, and I stopped
to repair it; then, as soon as I had her going, No. 4
blew out; I repaired it, then started again, when the
pump broke; I repaired it, and then found my cylinders
were not getting oil; and so on, all day until to-night.
I find my magneto "going bad"—and Lord only
knows how I can repair it! and the batteries are weak,
and we are just in a position to need the engines badly.
With the five-horse-power out of order and the seventy-horse-power
trying to get out of order, I feel pretty
blue, but Jack takes it all right. I'm going to call
Tehei now and go to bed in the finest bed I've had for
a long time—the spinnaker sail folded up aft the
cockpit. I am wearing only a <i>lava-lava</i>, and this faint
sea-breeze blowing over me almost makes me forget
the engines and their troubles. I have a good lantern
and a good book, so I'll get a little reading before
I go to sleep.</p>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Sunday, June 28, 1908.</h3>—Jack called all hands on
deck to make sail at six this morning, after which I
went to the engine room just to look at the engine and
see if I could find some way to make it run. I just
turned the wheel over in order to test the spark, when
she started off as nice as could be. I turned on the <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>p287</span>
propeller and stuck my head out of the hatch to see
everyone on board jumping for the steering-wheel, for
we had been in a dead calm, and no one was in the
cockpit. Ahead was a little blue patch of land, miles
and miles away, which we started for. Well, from six-thirty
this morning to one-thirty this afternoon that engine
ran without a kick. In an hour we picked up another
island ahead, then another, two little patches of
land lying just off the mainland. The passage between
was about a mile and a quarter. Up this we steamed.
We could see the natives on both beaches running to
their canoes, but we were going too fast for them.
We went in Port Mary on Santa Anna island. Hundreds
of natives ran down the beaches, and tumbling
into canoes, darted after us, all the time screaming
at the top of their voices. After edging through the
small lagoon and dropping anchor, we were surrounded
in an incredibly short time by a hundred canoe-loads
of savages—people who in looks and actions fully
justified my expectations of what South Sea Islanders
should be like. They started aboard, but with guns
we kept them back; and they circled round the <i>Snark</i>,
waving spears and clubs and shouting at the top of
their voices. And their looks certainly made necessary
the precautions we took, for they were a most
savage-looking lot.</div>

<p>They had big heads of bushy hair. Half of them
wore large nose-rings of tortoise shell and of wild-boar
tusks. All of them were adorned with ear-rings. <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a>p288</span>
Some ears were plugged with small logs of wood, two
inches in diameter. One had the handle of an old
teacup in his ear. The men of the New Hebrides
looked truly civilised beside these fierce and grotesque
figures. One of the islanders had the tin-wire sardine-can
openers in his ears; but the strangest of all was
the one who had the shell of a clock depending from
the cartilage of his nose. All had anklets and armlets,
and wore short <i>lava-lavas</i> of native cloth. And all
were armed with spears, bows and arrows, and clubs.
Some had immense bamboo combs in their hair; and
through the noses of fully half our visitors were thrust
long bamboo needles—clear through, so that the ends
stuck out far beyond the cheeks; and on these ends
were, in some cases, hung little rings, or pieces of shell.
Their cheeks were tattooed in monstrous designs: little
boys ornamented and tattooed just as fantastically
as were the elders. Their teeth were filed to points,
and were dead black; their lips, large and negroid,
were ruby red.</p>

<p>Their canoes were the prettiest and most graceful
of any we have yet seen. They are not mere dugouts
with an outrigger, but long double-ended light-shell
boats, the bows making a graceful curve several feet
in the air. There is no outrigger. The canoes are
paddled with long, slim, strangely carved paddles.
Each boat is painted a different design, like a fine piece
of tapa cloth. They glided round the <i>Snark</i> in the
twinkling of an eye. It was all we could do to keep <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a>p289</span>
the savages from boarding us. Not that they acted
hostile, but they looked it.</p>

<p>Soon other canoes arrived from the other island,
and there is no use denying that we were getting pretty
well frightened, until, along about the middle of the
afternoon, a canoe with only one occupant came alongside,
and a big, naked savage, uglier than the rest,
paddled round and round the <i>Snark</i>, trying to attract
our attention. He smiled an ugly, ghastly smile
that made us shudder, and finally, when he had our attention,
he stood upright in his canoe, and with a bow
that was meant to be graceful, said: "How-de-do,"
and then, losing his balance, fell into the water, his
canoe turned over, and those three or four hundred
cannibals laughed until their sides ached. It turned
the tide for us, for the native swam to the side of the
<i>Snark</i> and we could not refuse to let him aboard.
Then he started talking English to us, real genuine
English, and so far as I can remember, this is what
he said:</p>

<p>"What name he belong you? Peter he name belong
me. You no fright along people along Santa
Anna, every people he stop along shore. He good
people. You come along shore along me, me make
'm good time along you too much."</p>

<p>Being questioned, Peter told us that he had worked on
a plantation for a missionary, and that the missionary
had taught him English. He said that his people were
good people, and asked us to go ashore with him.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>p290</span></p>

<p>Only one white man is on this island, a trader named
Tom Butler. He had been to the other side of the
island, but hearing of our arrival, he came aboard
from his cutter, which, loaded with cocoanuts, was on
the way home. Butler is nearly in his grave. He
could scarcely get aboard, for he seems to be nearly
paralysed. He was a sailor on a trading schooner
until his mate was killed and <i>kai-kai'd</i> (eaten). He
killed seven of the natives and could not get aboard
again, so made his way here, and has been trading ever
since. As he came over the rail, he whispered to Jack
to watch out for Peter, the native who speaks English.
He said he had tried to spear the manager of a
big island trading concern who came here in his
own schooner six months ago. These natives are
all head-hunters. This village and the one across
the bay are continually at war with each other, and
each tribe collects the heads of the other tribe. Jack
and Mrs. London went ashore with him, and brought
back news that it is the most heathenish place they ever
saw. The women, they say, are naked. Large carved
totem poles in the centre of the village are covered
with obscene figures. The natives are all armed with
clubs, spears and bows. To-morrow I shall go ashore,
and see for myself. In the morning the natives are
coming out with weapons and other curios for us to buy.
I'm very much frightened about my right foot. On
the shin a large sore, big as a dollar, has started, and
it is eating right into my leg. It seems that no medicine <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a>p291</span>
aboard will cure it, and there is no doctor within
thousands of miles that we know of. My ankle and
leg has swollen to twice its natural size. Jack, I'm
afraid, has one of these eating ulcers, too. If no
doctor is on Florida Island, and if we are no better
when we get there, I think we will sail for Sydney,
Australia, for treatment, and that without delay.</p>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Monday, June 29, 1908.</h3>—I meant to do some work
to-day on the engines, but early this morning the natives
started coming with things for us to buy. Jack and
Mrs. London sat on their couch on deck with a few
hundred sticks of tobacco and a satchelful of beads
and red handkerchiefs, coloured calico and cheap jewellery,
and started buying. And here ended my attempt
to work on the engines. Jack asked me to let
him buy anything I wanted, as he wished to keep a uniform
price. All morning he traded, then knocked
off for dinner, and started again in the afternoon.
By night he had about two hundred different curios.
For me he got seven spears, all different, two dancing-sticks,
two war-clubs, two fine hair-ornaments, two
ear-plugs out of the same man's head, one sennit
ear-stick, ten anklets and armlets, one calabash
(which has been used to drain human blood), two
hand-clubs, two fine big shells, and scores of other
little trinkets. The whole thing cost fifty sticks of
tobacco and one handkerchief. On our deck is a pile
of fruit and yams and pumpkins three feet high.
Bunches of bananas are hanging to the mainmast, along <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>p292</span>
with eleven pigeons as big as chickens. One sucking
pig, cleaned and ready to cook, was sent out by the
trader. About one dozen large shell-fish, fine raw,
lie aft.</div>

<p>All day canoes have come and gone, long, graceful,
light, and strangely painted. Sometimes there would
be fifty naked men on deck at one time, fierce-looking
fellows, their ears full of rings and plugs and sticks.
Some carry their pipes there. Some wore great shell
nose-rings; others had porpoise teeth stuck in the ends
of their noses. Their faces were tattooed and cut in
strange designs. In their big bushy heads were
feathers and bamboo combs. Of anklets and armlets
we bought nearly all they had—two yards of calico
would easily make breech-clouts for fifty of these men,
so they effected rapid exchanges.</p>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Tuesday, June 30, 1908.</h3>—Again this morning we
traded with the natives until we are wondering where
we will put the things. About one hundred spears
alone are hard to pack away. After lunch, Jack, Mrs.
London, and I went ashore in the launch. As we
could not get clear up to the beach, Tehei had to
carry us out of the boat. We had our guns strapped
on, and carried four kodaks. We went up to the
trader's house. Imagine our surprise to find a whole
beachful of naked girls. Absolutely naked. Jack
looked at me and then at Mrs. London, and I looked
back at them. Each was anxious to see how the others
would act. But these people did not appear sensual <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a>p293</span>
or unnatural at all. They were just like animals. We
each turned our eyes shoreward and tried to look unconcerned
and as if we had been used to such things all
our lives. We sat on the porch and talked with the
trader, while the girls got us cocoanuts. These girls,
from ten to twenty years of age, had a few strings of
beads around their waists, some had a single string
hanging in front, and there were anklets and armlets
and necklaces; but of garments to hide their nakedness
there was nothing at all. Some of them were not bad
looking, save for the black, pointed teeth and the hideously
red lips. I was told that the teeth were coloured
by chewing the betel-nut. With Peter guiding us, we
tramped about a quarter of a mile to the village, a hundred
natives in the path ahead and a hundred behind.
And we kept our hands on our guns all the time, for
this would be a fine place for the islanders to get some
<i>kai-kai</i> (food) for a cannibal banquet. And I have
little doubt that our heads are vastly coveted.</div>

<p>At length, we came to a log bridge, over a shallow
stream of water. Mrs. London was not allowed to
go over—she must wade through, as this bridge is
taboo to women. Jack could not resist chaffing Mrs.
London, for up to this time she has been treated like
a lady by the natives we have come in contact with, but
here a woman is only a woman, and has none of the
rights of men. Poor Mrs. London was humiliated,
but Jack enjoyed it. We came into the village. Men
and women too old and feeble to walk would peep at <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>p294</span>
us through their grass houses. We came upon a
mammoth grass house, facing the sea. This place was
as large as a good-sized store-room. From the front
protruded the ends of war canoes. We wanted to see
them better; but Mrs. London was again stopped, and
in company with Peter, Jack and I went inside and inspected
two canoes large enough to hold fifty men
each, and a dozen smaller ones. These were the war
canoes, used only for the fighting. At the rear of the
house was a large coffin-shaped grass box. We looked
in, then stepped back in horror; and holding our noses,
Jack and I beat a hasty retreat, for inside the box was
the body of a man, looking like a pin-cushion, so full
was he with sharp barbs. Peter told us that he was
the best king that ever ruled them, that he had been
dead a week, and that the points in his body were the
arrow-points used in their envenomed arrows. Everyone
knows that a dead body contains the most virulent
poison in the world. By steeping their arrow-points
in a chief's body, they think that the poison will be
more effective. I bought one hundred and fifty of
these arrows. But I shall have to be careful how
I touch them.</p>

<p>As we passed out, we saw several old men squatted
in front of the house, making hollow wooden fishes by
the use of stone axes. We were told by Peter that
these men were chiefs, and that after they die their
bodies will be allowed to putrify. Then, after the arrow-points
have been poisoned in their decaying flesh, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>p295</span>
their bones will be put in one of the hollow fishes and
set on a shelf in the canoe-house, where we saw about a
hundred such fishes. The old men were making their
own coffins.</p>

<p>We went through the village, which is closed in by
a fence of small sticks woven together. The houses
touch one another, so that the whole village covers
only a few acres, with streets about ten feet wide. In
a small square at the centre stand tall carved images.
At the foot of the village, in a small enclosure about
twenty feet square, they showed us the graveyard.
Every body goes into the same hole. The pit is simply
opened up, the body tossed in, and then it is covered
over again. Scores of naked women and children
followed us about, and large men with clubs and spears.
I really did not feel any too safe. They showed us
another boat house in which rested a big log-fish, filled
with the bones of chiefs. I made photographs of the
women and men. Jack made head studies. Then,
walking back through the streets, I took pictures of
houses. For Jack I made a picture of two men whom
the sharks had bitten. One had his leg bitten clear off;
the other had all the flesh stripped from the bone.</p>

<p>We then went back to the clearing in the centre of
the village, where the men gave a dance for us, while
half a dozen old rascals sat in the centre making dance
music on hollow logs. We gave the dancers tobacco
and each a handful of cheap candy; and then Peter
took us to see his wives—two of them, and fine looking <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a>p296</span>
ladies they were. They were not naked, but each
wore a short fringe of grass, the smallest dresses I
have ever seen, and, I believe, the smallest dresses in
the world. I bought one of them from Peter's elder
wife.</p>

<p>We went back to the trader's house, where five young
girls danced a very pretty dance, making a hissing
sound for music. Mrs. London gave them a string of
beads each. We came back to the boat and ate supper;
then for several hours on deck the Japanese boys
danced, and Wada acted out some pantomime. Tehei
danced the Tahitian <i>hula-hula</i> and Henry did the
Samoan <i>seva-seva</i>. Nakata is a fine dancer. All the
while, Mrs. London played Hawaiian <i>hulas</i> on her
<i>ukelele</i>. We had a good time until so late that I did
not have to stand my watch, and Tehei stood only part
of his. We have to keep "anchor watch," for a little
wind from the west might make us swing on the reef—and
then, we can't trust the natives.</p>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Wednesday, July 1, 1908.</h3>—Again all morning Jack
bought curios, until we have just cleaned out the village.
I got a few more things, among them an arrow
with a special poison tip. Jack made the chief several
presents to get up a dance for us in the afternoon, so
right after lunch we were taken ashore in the launch
by Henry, and were escorted to the village by a young
chief. There we found more men making the hollow
fish-coffins. It took some time to get the dance started,
but finally fourteen young men lined up in two rows <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a>p297</span>
and eight squatted in a circle with a flat board for a
drum—one man striking it with a stick, the rest chanting.
I can't describe the dance. It was similar to
an Indian war-dance, and yet not the same. They
jumped around, yelled, alternately squatted and stood,
keeping up much the same thing for an hour and a
half. Then Jack and I gave out more candy and sticks
of tobacco. The naked girls stood around in the
circle, curiously watching us. One old man with only
a stump of an arm asked for a stick of tobacco. We
found out that he had lost the arm while dynamiting
fish—the explosive went off too soon. On the way
back, he stopped us at his hut, and made Mrs. London
a present of a sennit armlet. This was the only
present given us by the natives here. At length we
got back to the <i>Snark</i>, where we found that the trader
had sent us a big string of fish. A native got us a
dozen pigeons to-day. We found several young breadfruit,
and with plenty of <i>kai-kai</i> we sail out of here in
the morning.</div>

<p>That night, Peter, the native came aboard, and told
us that if we wanted to get our washing done, his wife
would do it for us; so it was settled that early next
morning Nakata was to go ashore and help with it.
Next morning, almost before sun-up, Nakata went
ashore. A little later we white people followed; but
we found no washing done. The Japanese are great
practical jokers in their quiet way. We found Nakata <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a>p298</span>
trying to show the naked women how to wear Mrs.
London's clothes. He succeeded very well, until he
accidentally tickled one of them, and immediately they
all jumped a good arm's length away from him; and
as those on whom he had succeeded in getting dresses
did not know how to get them off, and for fear of being
tickled would not allow him to touch them, there
was no washing done.</p>

<p>Next morning, Jack called all hands and they
heaved anchor, while I started the engine and we
steamed out of the harbour. We went about two
miles before I shut down; then we flew along with
an eight-knot breeze up the coast of the big island
of San Christoval (or Bauro), an island seventy-two
miles long by twenty-five wide. A missionary lived
on one end of San Christoval, and a trader on the other
end, and the people were killing and eating each other
right along.</p>

<p>At three o'clock, Jack told me to start the engine, as
the breeze was dying out, and he was afraid of being
caught on a bad coast with no moon to steer by and
reefs all about. We decided to stop at a small island
six miles off San Christoval—Ugi is its name, and it
has a good harbour. When we were about five miles
off, a whale-boat with a white man and half a dozen
black boys came alongside, and I stopped the engine
until he got aboard; then we pushed on again with his
boat towing behind. He was a Mr. Drew, a member
of the Melanesian Missionary Society, stationed on <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a>p299</span>
San Christoval. He accompanied us to Ugi, and decided
to go to Florida Island with us. We got in just
at dark, and were met by a trader in his dingy, who
piloted us to a good anchorage alongside his little ketch,
a hundred yards off shore. His name was Hammond.
He was an Australian who had only been here one
month. The last man got frightened and left, for the
natives of Malaita, a very savage island, had come
down in canoes and killed nearly every trader that
ever set up in business here; and he had got word from
one of his boys that they were coming again. Hammond
had been in the Solomons for eleven years, however,
and spoke the language well. He told us that
two years before he had landed at Port Mary—our
last anchorage—just as the natives were coming back
from San Christoval, victorious in a fight with one of
the hostile tribes; and these Port Mary natives were
heavily laden with war trophies, such as heads, arms
and legs.</p>

<p>The two men stayed for supper, and we held long
and interesting conversations with them, in the course
of which we learned many new things of the dark islands
into which we had poked the <i>Snark's</i> nose.</p>

<p>The next morning, July 3, we had the best treat we
had had for ages—milk, sweet, fresh cow's milk!
One glass apiece! Mr. Hammond had sent it over
before we were up. I had almost forgotten that milk
grew in anything except cans. Mr. and Mrs. London
went ashore to see the natives, while I stayed aboard <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a>p300</span>
to give my clothing a good overhauling, and to sew for
myself some <i>lava-lavas</i>. Several natives came out to
trade curios, but they had the same things we had gotten
in Port Mary, so I did not buy.</p>

<p>The next day, Saturday, was the Fourth of July.
In the morning we discharged a round of ammunition
from each of our guns, and that was our celebration—quite
different from the one the year before at Honolulu.
At ten o'clock the trader came alongside in his
whale-boat, manned by his Santa Cruz boys, and we
went to the village. A crowd met us at the beach.
The women here were clothed, each in a yard of calico.
They were all Christians, so they said; but I confess
that the heathens we had previously met were far more
hospitable and were better looking. The old chief
led us around the village, which, like the one at Port
Mary, was enclosed by a low fence. The huts all faced
a narrow street, and the rear of the huts was flush
with the fence. The huts themselves were the dirtiest
things I ever saw—of grass and sides and roof,
very low, with a bamboo porch in front. On the inside
was a dirty sleeping bunk of bamboo. Of other
furniture there was little or none.</p>

<p>We returned late that afternoon, and went aboard
the <i>Snark</i>. Jack went through the medicine chest,
trying to find something that would cure the large
ulcer on my shin. Every day found this growing in size
and soreness; and I became seriously concerned. At
Port Mary, I had asked the trader, Butler, about it, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a>p301</span>
and he had told me that it was a "yaw," or Solomon
Island sore, to which all white men were subject. Corrosive
sublimate, he further declared, was the thing
to cure it. Now the result of corrosive sublimate on
a large raw surface like that! It burnt like fire, but
it seemed to help.</p>

<p>We now set out for a leisurely circuit of the larger
islands. In this circuit, it was our luck to see thousands
of cannibals, and also to observe the work done
by the missionaries among these benighted savages.
Right here, let me explain that cannibalism is not practised
because of any love of human flesh, but rather
because the natives believe that they acquire the fighting
qualities of the men that they eat. Thus they hope
to get the strength and prowess in battle of their enemies;
and for his reason, they like to eat white men,
whose skill and courage they admire.</p>

<p>We never saw a cannibal feast, but we saw plenty
of evidence of the practice in the thousands of human
bones on shores and reefs.</p>

<p>All these cannibals are head-hunters. One may see
tiny mummified heads stuck up outside the huts. The
more heads a man has, the stronger he imagines himself
to be. A man with fifteen heads reckons himself
as strong as fifteen men. The mummified heads
are taken from enemies in battle. The bones are all
drawn out, and then the head is dried until it is only
the size of one's fist. To possess the head of a white
man is a special honour. A village with a white man's <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a>p302</span>
head considers that it has a wonderful talisman. Naturally,
we took great care not to become luck-bringers
for any of the natives among whom we sojourned.</p>

<p>Some years ago, a party of German scientists landed
at Malaita, one of the most inaccessible islands in the
group, to explore. They very much wanted to take
back some of these heads as relics, and offered fifteen
sticks of plug tobacco for each. The market was brisk
for a few days, but soon all the posts outside the huts
had been stripped, and the supply slackened. Then
suddenly trade revived again—but it was noticed that
the heads brought in were fresh! It turned out that
the natives had been doing a little private killing in
order to keep up the supply. One native had sacrificed
several relatives in his desire to please the Germans
and get their tobacco.</p>

<p>And then the missionaries. There are so many different
kinds of missionaries in the South Seas that I
must divide them into their classes and try to tell of
these different classes as they appeared to me. Probably
another person going among them would see them
in a different light from what I did. Of course, I
cannot pretend to know all about what the missionaries
are doing in the South Seas, but I do know what some
of them were doing. Some of them were engaged in
excellent work—the noblest work in the world. And
some were doing absolutely no work. Let me tell
of both kinds, at the same time explaining that if
some of the missionaries are not doing what they ought, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a>p303</span>
it is no reason why we should shut our eyes to the fact
that there are others who toil eternally and well in
their allotted paths. For that matter, it is the frauds
who make it so hard for the missionary who works
in good faith for the regeneration of the savages.</p>

<p>Missionaries in Polynesia I have never considered
in these pages. For the eastern Pacific has reached
such a stage of civilisation that the missionaries are
now called preachers, and have their regular congregations,
just as in civilised countries.</p>

<p>The first missionary I had met was Rev. Watt,
at Tanna, New Hebrides. After twenty-eight years
at this same station, he had managed to convert about
two hundred mean, thieving little beggars. He made
the natives, as a sign of conversion, wear the ragged
and dirty clothing I have described, which clothes,
once put on, were probably never removed. As I
have said, these missionary boys stole everything they
could get their hands on, but of the scores of bush
natives that came aboard, we never caught one taking
a thing; and the heathen natives had offered to give
us a feast and to guide us to see their island, but the
missionary boys we had not been able to hire to guide
us, and for the fruit they brought aboard, they asked
many times its value. For my part, I can see no actual
good Rev. Watt has accomplished in all his twenty-eight
years. Trader Wiley, the big, genial Scotchman,
has done more towards civilising than has the
missionary. Wiley brought about peace between many <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a>p304</span>
of the tribes that before his advent were continually at
war. He also adjusts their quarrels; and the natives
come to him for advice and medicine, and for surgical
operations.</p>

<p>Dr. Drew, the missionary we met at Ugi, is stationed
on San Christoval. Dr. Drew, when he first landed,
started learning the native language, and it was over
a year before he began teaching the word of God
to the natives, but in that year he won the natives'
confidence. He worked on their pride by offering
prizes for the best-built house and the cleanest house.
He helped them lay out streets, and the dirty village,
with its houses stuck anywhere they could find ground
to put them, gradually took on a healthful, systematic
look, and natives from other villages came in and built
neat grass houses. Then Dr. Drew gave away as
prizes one yard of blue calico, only the one colour, and
soon the whole four hundred natives were wearing <i>lava-lavas</i>
just alike in shape and colour. Dr. Drew went
no further toward dressing them, for he realised that
as soon as a native puts on white man's clothes he begins
to imitate the white man, and to imitate the white
man in that part of the world is bad policy. Dr. Drew
did not attempt to become a native, but maintained his
dignity all the time he was learning the language.</p>

<p>After he had mastered the language, Dr. Drew
taught them to read in their own tongue, and then
translated the Bible for them. When we of the <i>Snark</i>
went among his four hundred Christian natives, we <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a>p305</span>
were treated better than any natives in the South Seas
had ever before treated us. And Dr. Drew caused
this great revival by setting an example, and not by
trying to beat religion into them. I doubt if any of
the natives knew what was happening, so gradual was
their uplifting, until they finally found themselves full-fledged
Christians—and that kind of Christian will
never backslide. If there were more such missionaries
in the South Seas, cannibalism and heathenism would
soon be a thing of the past. These natives now have
their cricket and football teams, and Dr. Drew teaches
them English, and cooking, and even boat-building and
sailing.</p>

<p>Another missionary, Mr. Whittier, came up from
Australia with a scheme to adopt the simple life. He
lived in a grass house, ate native goods, wore no other
clothing than the native <i>lava-lava</i>. His idea was to
live like the natives and become one of them, thinking
by this method that they would trust him better. But
it was no use, for when the white man lowered himself
to their level, they had no more respect for him.</p>

<p>As the little <i>Snark</i> poked her nose in and out of
savage ports, the first thing we looked to see was the
kind of <i>lava-lavas</i> the women wore. If they wore
cloth <i>lava-lavas</i>, they were invariably Christians, but
if they wore grass <i>lava-lavas</i>, or were naked, they were
heathens. But we could never be sure of the men by
this method, for they received the cloth <i>lava-lavas</i>
from the traders in exchange for cocoanuts. Of <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a>p306</span>
course, they kept all the traders gave them, and left
the women to hustle for themselves. As may be imagined,
it doesn't cost much to dress a woman in this
part of the world.</p>

<p>The principal good done by the missionaries—the
sincere missionaries—is that they take the natives out
of their horrible, dirty state and teach them self-respect;
and surely this is a big step toward civilisation.</p>

<p>The greatest good is being done by Church of England
missionaries, who own the finest mission ship in
the world, the <i>Southern Cross</i>. This ship, in its
cruising among the islands, persuades the best and most
intelligent natives to go with them to Norfolk Island.
Here they are put in a mission school, and later returned
to their homes to start schools of their own.
A white missionary is left with the new convert until
he has his church built and things are running smoothly;
then the native is left to shift for himself. Some of
the native missionaries have maintained good clean villages,
but the <i>Southern Cross</i> is needed about twice a
year to untangle the mismanaged affairs of most of the
stations, for however sincere the native teacher may
be, he seldom has any executive ability.</p>

<p>The native churches are generally the neatest
buildings in the village, and are used for schools as
well as for churches. The natives squat on the ground,
and use rough log benches for desks. Their church-bell
is a hollow log, and their contribution-box is always
of cocoanut or shell. Their singing is wonderfully <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a>p307</span>
pleasing, especially if a missionary has trained
them.</p>

<p>The Christian natives and the heathen natives always
seemed to be the best of friends. As a consequence,
the most incongruous things sometimes occur. In one
place, I saw a coffin-shaped box with a body sticking
full of barbs, and within a few hundred feet stood a
mission-house in charge of a native teacher. Native
missionaries are always called teachers. Why it is,
I do not know, but I have never heard a native Christian
worker called a missionary.</p>

<p>The French traders ten years ago traded off about
five hundred old Snyder rifles to the savages, and as
soon as a white man is known to be about, these old
rifles are gotten out for show. But they have no cartridges,
and if they had, I don't believe the guns would
shoot, for the muzzles of those I saw were stopped up
with rust.</p>

<p>On the island of Florida, in the Solomons, a missionary
made a whole village of converts by playing on
their childlike love for display. This missionary had
no influence with them for several months, until one day
a government schooner anchored and half a dozen
black police boys paraded the village, marching in time
and carrying guns. As soon as the government vessel
had departed, the boys of the villages were trying to
imitate the drilling of the police boys, using their old
Snyder rifles. The missionary was quick to take advantage
of this opportunity to get into their confidence, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a>p308</span>
and, by drilling the boys, he was soon in their good
graces; and gradually he turned their love of pomp
and display into more useful channels. And now he
has a well-founded mission-station and his chief asset
is his teams of drilled, athletic boys. Other teachers,
encouraged by his success, have taken up athletic work
among their followers.</p>

<p>One great difficulty to be overcome by these wilderness
apostles is the lack of concentration in savage
minds. It is difficult to keep a native's attention long
enough to teach him a lesson or to instill moral precepts.</p>

<p>I have noticed that doctors always make the best
missionaries. Their medical treatment will give them
a hold and win them confidence where nothing else
could. Also, a man is a better missionary than a
woman, among these savages. For a woman is not
respected. A big, strong, athletic man, who can do
things that the natives see with their own eyes are
better than what they can do, will always have a following,
but the man who relies solely upon preaching
will never do any good. But to be perfectly fair, I
must say that most of the missionaries whom I saw
were putting skill and enthusiasm into their work, toiling
by day and by night, and in most cases these simple
teachers were not putting forth their time and toil
in vain.

OCEANIC CRUISING</h2>
<p class="toclink"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></p>
<p>The Solomon group is divided into German and British
Solomons, but the British section, about twenty-five
large and small islands, being the more interesting,
we did not bother to look much into the German
section.</p>

<p>The large islands of Guadalcanar, Malaita, San
Christoval, and Ysabel are as yet entirely unexplored
in the interior. In none of these islands has anyone
been back more than a few miles from the coast.</p>

<p>On the island of Guadalcanar, an island eighty miles
long and forty miles wide, are half a dozen plantations
and a trading and mission station, in which probably
twenty-five persons live. Their homes are well
guarded and stockaded, but even with the most rigid
precautions, a white man is set down as missing at
frequent intervals. Only a few months ago, I received
a letter from a friend in the Solomons, telling
of the massacre of a trader at a station where the
<i>Snark</i> once anchored.</p>

<p>After our cruise in the western islands, the <i>Snark</i>
dropped anchor at the largest plantation in the Solomons,
called Penduffryn, on the island of Guadalcanar,
owned and managed by two Englishmen, George
Darbishire and Thomas Harding.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a>p310</span></p>

<p>As Mrs. London was not feeling well when we anchored
here, she was left at the plantation, while Jack
and I and the two Kanakas and two Japs took the
<i>Snark</i> over to the island of Tulagi, twenty-five miles
away. The engine ran all the way. We made the
twenty-five miles in three hours, dropping anchor at
Tulagi late in the evening. Jack and I went up the
side of an old extinct volcano to the house of the
Governor of the British Solomons. The Governor
was away, but the Assistant Governor received us, and
promptly fined Jack £5 for not getting pratique
papers here first. Otherwise we were treated hospitably.
Late that night Jack set out in a whale-boat
for Penduffryn, leaving the rest of us to get the boat
cleaned with the help of the Governor's native recruits.
For one week, twenty native divers scraped the <i>Snark's</i>
keel with cocoanut husks, and in company with a government
engineer, I took the <i>Snark</i> on short cruises,
testing the engines, and after everything had been
thoroughly overhauled, I took the <i>Snark</i> back across
the straits of Penduffryn, and went ashore to find a
regular reunion of white men.</p>

<p>There were traders old and young, <i>beche-de-mer</i>
fishermen, old beach-combers and blackbirders. All
were delighted to hear that visitors were at Penduffryn.
For one week, this largest group of white men
that ever gathered on the island of Guadalcanar made
things hum with good time. Everyone was so happy—and
we acted like children. We had big card games <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>p311</span>
and even a masquerade ball. Darbishire, who was
always the life of the plantation, dressed as an English
lady, and I was his partner to the dance. The
music did not amount to much, but Mrs. London's
Hawaiian <i>ukelele</i> made enough for us to dance by.
The merrymaking lasted several days, until it ended
by all present agreeing to take the Oriental dope
called <i>hashish</i>.</p>

<p>Darbishire was the first to partake. After he had
passed under the influence, we decorated him with
parts of Mrs. London's clothes, and I did a little artistic
work with water-colours. For several days he
went around the house in a half-dazed state, and would
at times drop dead asleep while standing on his feet.
One after another took this <i>hashish</i>, until the night
Jack took it. He went clear off his head, acted so
wild that Mrs. London was frightened; and no one
else would take it. Next night was to have been my
turn.</p>

<p>At Penduffryn they have seven native boys trained
to cook and do the housework, so it was very little
that the white people had to do. During the day I
usually worked aboard the <i>Snark</i>, rowing ashore at
night for late dinner. And then I was busy a good
deal of the time with my photographic work.</p>

<p>I seldom moved about at night, alone. The natives
were pretty restless just then at Lunga, a station fourteen
miles below here: eight blacks from Malaita
working at the station ran away to the bush, and threatened <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a>p312</span>
to get some white heads, then, stealing a boat,
to go back to Malaita. One day, at Penduffryn, a lot
of powder and cartridges was found in a hut belonging
to a native. The man was taken to the house and
handcuffed, and all the recruits were called in from
work. Then Mr. Harding told them that the man was
going to be sent to the Governor, who would sentence
him to three years hard, unpaid labour. Until a boat
left, no one was to speak to him. But the next morning,
when his handcuffs were taken off, the culprit
bolted, and thereafter made his appearance among the
other natives at night, inciting them to kill every white
man at Penduffryn.</p>

<p>After the loot was found, a search was made of all
the houses, and two fellows were found to have spears.
Again all the men were called from work, and before
them all these two fellows were forced to strip their
<i>lava-lavas</i>; and Mr. Darbishire, with a big boor-hide
whip, gave them the worst licking I ever saw anyone
get. He made deep cuts in their hide, from which
the blood spurted. It nearly made me sick, but I
knew the whipping was necessary; for it is solely by
intimidation that the white man rules in the Solomons.</p>

</div>

<p>Meanwhile, things were going badly with the <i>Snark</i>
crew.</p>

<p>Henry and Tehei were down with island fever.
Nakata had caught <i>ngari-ngari</i>, or scratch-scratch.
Jack had terrible yaws, and I had equally terrible yaws.
We, too, took occasional spells of fever. Dosings of <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a>p313</span>
quinine and applications of corrosive sublimate and
blue vitriol were daily occurrences. The blue vitriol
drove me nearly crazy—Jack called it horse doctoring;
but it was the best that I could do. Henry developed
<i>bukua</i> on his face; Tehei fainted several times,
and wept and prayed; all this made us the most invalided
crew ever seen in the South Seas. This much
I learned, however, from our tribulations: anyone
coming to the Solomons should first purchase a barrel
of quinine for the fever and a barrel of corrosive sublimate
for the yaws, and leave an order for more to
follow.</p>

<p>I was looking forward to getting out of this particular
part of the world. It was too wild and raw, too
full of sickness and sudden death. How I longed for
a real bed, with sheets, in a place where it was not
too hot to sleep! The rain pretty near drove us
out of the <i>Snark</i>. We had awning all over the deck,
and side curtains, but the tropical showers that blew
up in a minute and swept away the next were fast and
furious while they lasted. No matter how well the
canvas was set, the rain got through and pushed below
to our bunks. But I determined that in Australia I
would get two large ventilators for my room. Then
no rain could bother me, for the hatch would be shut.
Also, I was thinking seriously of fitting up my bunk
with sheets. If the <i>Snark</i> was to be home to me for
several years to come, I might as well arrange for
comfort.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a>p314</span></p>

<p>Because of Henry's and Tehei's sickness, Jack
thought it best to get a white man to look after things,
so he hired a German named Harry Jacobsen; a man
who had been mate of the <i>Minota</i>, a recruiting schooner
that had gone ashore on Malaita and been looted by
the savage islanders. The <i>Minota</i> had been recovered,
but just now was not putting out, so Jack was able
to get Mr. Jacobsen without much trouble. Our
machinery had gone wrong, and we had to wait at
Penduffryn until fresh parts came from Sydney, Australia.
It was during this wait that the <i>Minota</i> was
fitted out for another recruiting trip to Malaita. Captain
Jansen and Mr. Jacobsen invited Jack and Mrs.
London to go along on this blackbirding cruise; so I
was left in charge of the <i>Snark</i>.</p>

<p>Soon afterward, only twenty-five miles away, the
<i>Minota</i> grounded on the Mallua Reef, close to the cannibal
island of Malaita. Soon they were surrounded
by scores of man-eaters in canoes. Of course, Jack
and all the rest were well armed, but the savages
were so numerous and so treacherous that a day-and-night
watch had to be kept against a surprise and a
terrible death. They sent up rockets, which, as a
matter of fact, I saw; but I had no idea that it was
the <i>Minota</i> which was in trouble. I thought some
other vessel was on the rocks. Anyway, I was quite
unable to go to their help, with my engines out of order.
Their safety during the time taken to re-float the
<i>Minota</i> was really owing to the efforts of a missionary—one <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a>p315</span>
of the few missionaries in the Solomons who
had any influence with the cannibals. He got his mission-boys
to form a guard for passengers and crew,
and thus averted the peril. Poor fellow! he was
killed soon after.</p>

<p>In addition to the yaws and the fever, a new trouble
came into the life of the <i>Snark</i> family. Jack's hands
had begun to swell up, turn very sore, and peel skin.
The nails were very hard and thick, and had to be filed.
And it was the same with his feet. Nothing like it
had ever been heard of before. The traders and
beach-combers could diagnose yaws and fever, but not
this. Both Jack and Mrs. London were considerably
alarmed at this strange manifestation. "It is plain
we are not wanted in the South Seas," Jack said, more
than once. "California is the place for me."</p>

<p>"And me for Kansas," I assured him.</p>

<p>Wada and Nakata began to dilate upon the virtues
of Japan, while Henry and Tehei were praying day
and night that they might get back safely to the Society
Islands.</p>

<p>After we had lain at Penduffryn a time, Mr. London
decided that we would make a visit to the fabled
Ontong Java islands that the traders were telling us so
much about. They were situated about two hundred
miles away from the Solomons, and their exact location
was not known. The people were said to be of a
queer race, and as we were out to see the unusual, we
set sail from Penduffryn, and after two days' beating <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a>p316</span>
up the Invincible Straits, we anchored at the island of
Ysabel, and lay there seventeen days, trading and
hunting wild game. Here Wada, the cook, went clean
out of his head, and running away, went to live in a
village of coast natives; and we were compelled to sail
off without him. Jack promised Nakata a new suit
of clothes if he would do the cooking until we reached
a port where we could get a new cook. Nakata tried
to hold his own job and the cook's job, but got sick,
and then Tehei and Henry and I took turn-about getting
meals. When we sailed away from Ysabel, we
were forced to cut loose our big eight-hundred-pound
anchor, for it had gotten caught in the coral reefs so
tightly that it was impossible for us to get it out.</p>

<p>Ontong Java is about two hundred miles to the west
of Ysabel. Now and then a trading vessel comes here,
and once a year a steamer collects the annual output
of copra. I suppose the steamer knows the position.
Certainly it is never gotten from the chart.</p>

<p>The first day out of Ysabel we had fine weather, but
the next day the sea got rough, and for six days it
rained and blew as it only can in the tropics; and to
add to our discomfort, Tehei got blackwater fever and
lay down on deck fully decided to die. Nakata was
still sick, and to cap matters he got a second dose of
ptomaine poisoning. Mrs. London and Jack came
down with fever, and their yaws grew worse. Henry's
<i>bukua</i> continued to bother him. And I daily writhed
in the agony of alternate washes of blue vitriol and corrosive <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a>p317</span>
sublimate. We were so sick and miserable that
very little attention was paid to the navigating, and for
several days we sailed in a half-hearted way, looking
for the islands. One day, Jack's observations indicated
that we were inside the lagoon, and next day we had
sailed clear past the islands. But one morning Henry
called all hands on deck to see the cocoanut trees just
visible above the horizon. We sailed up the coast of
small islands, some of them only large enough for one
cocoanut tree, and the greatest no larger than an ordinary
city block. These thirty-nine islands circled
around a lagoon ten miles wide. Not one of these
islands was over two feet above the water-line, and
absolutely the only vegetation was the thickly growing
cocoanut trees.</p>

<p>While looking for an opening between the little
islands, a canoe with two occupants paddled off from
one of the islands and we let them aboard. It was
certainly a surprise to see Polynesians again, instead
of the little woolly-headed negroids of the Solomons.
These men were big, brown-skined, straight-haired fellows—that
is, their hair would have been straight,
had they ever combed it. As they came over the rail,
Henry spoke to them in his own tongue; and what was
our amazement to hear them answer him. And then
Tehei decided that he wouldn't die, and started talking
to them.</p>

<p>Our surprise will be appreciated when I say that
these people's rightful home was five thousand miles <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a>p318</span>
to the eastward. They did not know that there were
any others in this part of the world who could speak
their language. They piloted us inside the lagoon,
and then to our further surprise we saw a white man's
frame house on the beach of the largest island. When
we dropped anchor, this man came aboard, and a happy
man he was that day. For it was a lonesome time he
had, with a sight of white people only once a year,
when the steamer came after his copra.</p>

<p>He was a Dutchman, and had lived here so long that
he had almost forgotten how to speak English. We
came ashore with him, and went directly to his home.
While we were there a small boy brought up a tiny
shark's jaw and presented it to Jack with the king's
compliments. As we had bought these small jaws for
a half-stick of tobacco, Jack was disgusted and started
to throw it away, but I asked for it and he gave it to
me.</p>

<p>Then we were taken to see the king, who was squatting
on a mat in the centre of a large grass house, his
half-dozen wives seated around him. We shook hands,
and with the trader as interpreter Jack made the king
a present of coloured calico and some tobacco, and
then told the king that he must give us a hundred
cocoanuts in return. The old king started to say no,
until Jack made as if to take back his presents, when
the king hastily ordered the cocoanuts to be sent
aboard. We went on through the village and came to
the graveyard, and it was the most remarkable graveyard <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a>p319</span>
I have ever seen. The graves lay so close together
that there was scarcely room for a tombstone.
The tombstones were straight slabs of granite, with
no writing, but some of them had queer heads attached.
There were no mounds over the graves—they sparkled
with pure white sand, beaten flat; and all the
graves were levelled off the same way, until they appeared
like a long, paved sidewalk. At the outer
edge of the graveyard were three wooden crosses that
marked the graves of the former wives of the Dutch
trader. He pointed to the three graves with pride,
and later on he showed us his three living wives. He
informed us that if one of them didn't make copra
better he might find it necessary to make a cross for
her—and I believe he meant it. For he was very
brutal. A fine handsome young fellow had attached
himself to our party wherever we went, and once the
Dutchman gave him a crushing blow with his fist,
apparently without reason. After that, Obi held
aloof.</p>

<p>On going back to the trader's house, we noticed a
Solomon Islander working around the place. When
we asked why this native should be so far away from
home, we learned that he had been recruited about five
years before to work on a plantation for the trading
company, and had been put at this lagoon to prevent
his getting way. Those who have read Jack London's
story, "Mauki," will understand, for this native was
the original of that interesting character.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a>p320</span></p>

<p>We lay at this lagoon for nearly a week. I got a
great deal of fine coral in all colours of the rainbow,
but it all faded white, except the red, which was so
brittle that it broke to pieces. I saw trees of coral
twenty feet high, and wonderful gardens of it, through
which parrot-coloured fish swam in and out.</p>

<p>After piling our cockpit full of green cocoanuts that
the king's subjects had selected for us, we had prepared
to leave, when word came to us that across the lagoon
were two missionaries, a Samoan and a Tonga Islander,
who wanted to see us. The Dutchman had been careful
not to tell us of them, for a very good reason.</p>

<p>Why the Dutchman did not want us to know of these
missionaries, perhaps the most remarkable in the world,
we soon learned after we had left this lagoon and
stumbled on to another.</p>

<p>Two years before the time we were at Ontong Java,
the mission-ship <i>Southern Cross</i> had steamed into this
harbour with two missionaries, one of them from
Samoa, the other from the Tonga Islands. These two
men tried hard to land, but the natives said no, that
their idols were good enough for them and they had
no desire to change—if the white men wanted to land
there would be no resistance, but no dark-skinned natives
were going to be allowed to tell them about new
gods.</p>

<p>The <i>Southern Cross</i> could not afford to remain long
at this place, for it kept them moving to make their
rounds twice a year, so the two missionaries were left <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a>p321</span>
with fifty days' food and water in an open boat. Then
for fifty days these missionaires tried to land, but were
met with spears at the beach; and when the food and
water was all gone, the Dutch trader took pity on them,
and told the king that he had received a message from
the great white master, saying that if the men were
not allowed to land they would send schooners and
kill everyone on the islands.</p>

<p>The king then allowed the trader to take the men
in his house and nurse them; and after they returned
to health they built neat grass houses and tried to work
among the islanders, but their work went slowly and
it was not until the Dutch trader killed one of his
wives and the missionaries proved it on him that they
gained any hold. Then the missionaries started a
crusade against the trader, but the natives did not have
the courage to deport him, and it got so warm for the
missionaries that they were notified to leave the largest
island and never return. Then these missionaries
went to live on another island, and for years they
never saw any civilised people, for the trader took
good care that no vessels ever anchored across the
lagoon. When we of the <i>Snark</i> sailed over to them,
they cried, they were so glad to see white people. We
gave them potatoes and tinned goods, and promised to
report them at the government station when we got
back to the Solomons.</p>

<p>We then sailed out of the lagoon and headed west
with a large crowd of natives following in canoes. We <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a>p322</span>
were clear of the islands by sundown, and Jack set
the course for another lagoon that was reported to
be some two hundred miles farther west, and the
watches were set with confidence of a perfect night's
rest. Just enough wind was blowing to keep the sails
full, and there was scarcely a ripple on the water.
Wada and Tehei kept their watch; then I was called
on deck, and was lazily smoking and steering at the
wheel. Everyone else was asleep on deck and I was
only enough awake to keep the <i>Snark's</i> head on the
course, when I heard a slight rustling on the water
ahead, which increased in volume until it rose into the
unmistakable roar of a reef. Hastily bringing the
vessel up into the wind, I roused all hands and after a
good look at the reef, Jack ordered the <i>Snark</i> about,
and until morning we beat back and forth. When
daylight came we were in sight of another small lagoon
that looked like Ontong Java in miniature. We had
no trouble getting inside the reef, and sailed five miles
across the lagoon to the largest island, and dropped
anchor. In no time at all our decks were crowded
with big, brown Polynesians, who, while they seemed
healthy fellows, appeared absolutely devoid of intellect.</p>

<p>We tried hard to get some spears, but the natives
refused to sell, no matter what we offered. There
were about fifty of them: soon they began chanting
a weird kind of song. We found that this was in
honour of their king, who was on his way out to us.</p>

<p class="xpno"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a>p323</p>

<p>Shortly a canoe finer than the rest came alongside,
and the old bewhiskered king, a fine old chap with
nose-rings and ear-rings, came over the rail. We received
a shock, for his body was covered with tattooed
designs of guns. The old fellow ordered the natives
to the stern of the boat, and, advancing, made us a
speech of welcome. We tried to get his King-spear,
a beautifully carved weapon, designed to catch a victim
going or coming, but he would not part with it. Of
course, we were expected to make the king a present.
It had been a joke with us about the useless things
that kings and chiefs had been giving us; so more in
the spirit of a jest than anything else, Mrs. London
gave this king an old night-gown of hers. He seemed
so vastly pleased that Mrs. London put it on him.
That did the trick: he was so delighted that he at
once gave us his King-spear; and for days we saw
him running about the island in the night-gown, the
proudest man in the world, and certainly the best-dressed
native for miles around.</p>

<p>With the idea of showing us what a great and lordly
king he was, he invited us ashore, and parading us
through the village, he called all his subjects together
and made a speech to them. I don't know what he
said, but they were highly pleased; and that night
a dance was given for us. We noticed the same
people we had seen in the afternoon; and next day,
on going to some of the close-by islands, we found
them uninhabited, and gradually it dawned upon us <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a>p324</span>
that the first group of people we had seen were the
sole inhabitants of the Tasman Lagoon. On counting
them, we found fifty-nine men and forty-eight women,
and only one baby. It was easy to see the finish of
these people. They had married and intermarried
until every solitary native was closely related to every
other native; and should they continue to intermarry
so closely, should there be no infusion of fresh blood,
their race must become thoroughly idiotic, and soon
go down to death.</p>

<p>I believe the most peculiar trait of these people was
their idol or devil-devil worship. They had no good
god, but believed that if they kept their devil-devil
in good humour, everything would be well, and that
if the devil-devil should get angry, they would have
floods and diseases and everything in general would
go to ruin. To keep the devil-devil in good humour,
they had built large houses with fresh mats for him
to sleep on; and every boat or house that was built
must first be passed on by their wooden devil-devil,
and by certain signs they could tell whether he was
pleased or not. One of these devils I sent back to
America, and I still have it.</p>

<p>At this island, we found another of those queer
graveyards that we had seen in Ontong Java. There
were hundreds and hundreds of these strange graves,
which proved that the reefs comprising this lagoon
had once been well inhabited.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a>p325</span></p>

<p>We collected several of their peculiar grass dresses
at this place. I secured one just before it was finished.</p>

<p>There are dozens of islands in the Solomon group
where few white men have ever been seen in the interior,
and there are islands where a white man has
never been seen at all. We made a call at one of
these places—quite an accidental call. We were
caught in the tail end of a hurricane and were blown
about for a time, not knowing in the least where we
were. Then there came a sudden calm, and we found
ourselves near a little group of islands. Presently,
the natives came out in canoes to see us. They were
quite naked, and had straight hair standing out in
huge masses around their heads. When they saw us,
they were the most amazed people in the world. They
felt our white skins, and rubbed them, to see if the
colour would come off. Everything was bewildering
to them. Once we thought that they were getting
dangerous, and I presented my revolver at one of
them. The man coolly took it by the muzzle, thinking
it was a toy meant as a present. As with all the
other savages, they were delighted with the mechanical
toys we showed them. A Jack-in-the-box would keep
a huge chief happy for hours. One of them found an
old file, and thought it the greatest treasure in the
world.</p>

<p>They left us rather suddenly. It was my fault. <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a>p326</span>
Thinking to amuse them, I started the dynamo with
which we lighted the boat, and gave one of them a
shock. He yelled, jabbered something to the others,
and at once they all sprang overboard and swam
ashore. They didn't stop for their canoes, which we
were obliged to cut adrift.</p>

<p>At night, a lot of them stood on the beach looking
at us. We turned the searchlight on them, and as
it swept along the shore, they shrieked and fled. Nor
did they stop until they had reached the other end of
the island, two miles away.</p>

<p>That particular island was not marked on our chart,
nor was it on the latest and best charts that I later
consulted at Sydney. Until we went to the place, the
people believed that their little speck of an island,
hundreds of miles from any other land, was the whole
world. They knew nothing of tobacco or gin, which
are so dear to other South Sea Islanders. And I have
little doubt that there are many other islands hereabouts,
where the natives believe themselves the only
human beings in existence.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the natives were never frightened
or annoyed when I took photographs. They did not
understand what it was all about, and they didn't care.
But when I developed the plates and showed them their
own pictures, they were delighted. In many places,
they had never seen a picture before. There was one
old chief whose photograph I took. When I showed
him a print, he at once sent messengers to all the <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a>p327</span>
islands round, and the people trooped in to see the
wonder. I suppose they're still admiring it, if they
haven't worn it out with admiration.</p>

<p>We made fast time back to the Solomons. We
spent several days beating through the Manning
Straits between the islands of Ysabel and Choiseul.
The tides ran so strong here that it was all we could
do to get through, and in many places we would pass
clusters of little islands so slowly that the natives in
canoes would surround us, and try to get aboard, but
these woolly-headed people were so savage-looking that
we did not care to allow them on our deck.</p>

<p>In this strait we passed queer little islands built upon
reefs out from the main islands. These little handmade
islands were inhabited as thickly as the people
could stick on them, by coast natives that had been
driven off the larger islands by the bush men coming
down to the salt-water villages; and when the coast
natives were forced to retreat, there was no place
for them to go except to the reefs, so gradually there
sprang up a reef-dwelling people who are never allowed
to land on the mainland. As the bush boys
are afraid of the water, they never attempt to make
canoes, and the reef natives control the water so effectively
that the bush men dare not even fish in the salt
water; and as the reef natives cannot produce enough
cocoanuts and fruit to keep them in a variety of foods,
the two tribes compromise by allowing their women to
come together on the beach, where fish are traded <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a>p328</span>
for fruits and nuts. Men never dare come to the
market-place where this trading is effected.</p>

<p>During the hurricane a few years ago, several of
these islands were destroyed, and for several weeks
the inhabitants were paddling among the different
islands looking for a safe place to land. Some landed
at hostile places and were killed. Others started new
villages in uninhabited places; and some were unfortunate
enough to land near plantations, and were
forced into service. The traders were only too glad
to get new recruits without the expense of blackbirding
them.</p>

<p>As we passed out of the Manning Straits, we sailed
past part of the German Solomons. On clear days
we could see patrols of war canoes paddling up and
down the coasts of the different islands, and often
would pass close to small canoes on fishing trips. We
let some of the natives come aboard the <i>Snark</i> and
traded for the fish they carried. I believe that was
one of the most interesting experiences that fell to
me in the South Seas—to see these different people
in their canoes, and now and then to stop to trade with
them or to make photographs.</p>

<p>We dropped anchor for two days at an island north
of Guadalcanar, where we knew there was a plantation.
We were treated hospitably by Mr. Nichols,
the owner of the plantation. And here we discovered
another interesting bit of history in regard to Henry,
our Polynesian sailor. Some years before, Mr. <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a>p329</span>
Nichols had managed a pearling station on Christmas
Island, and Henry was his chief diver. He had
found a pearl that was worth a large sum of money,
and when he turned it over to Mr. Nichols, he and
Nichols were attacked by the other pearl divers and
the pearl was stolen. The natives took it to Papeete,
Tahiti, where they sold it for half its value. Mr.
Nichols asked as a favour that Henry might stay
ashore a couple of days with him; and then the two
got together like a couple of old soldiers talking over
the war.</p>

<p>It was early in the morning that we slid out of the
island, on the most perfect day possible. We pushed
down the coast of Guadalcanar, the awnings set and
the engines running smoothly. Not a bit of wind was
stirring. As we three white people were now in an
awful state with yaws, and Jack's mysterious sickness
was growing worse all the time, it was decided that we
should get back to Penduffryn by the time the steamer
arrived, so that we could get our wounds doctored.
The blue vitriol washes were driving us to distraction,
but thus only could we keep the disease from
spreading.</p>

<p>Finally, after being away two months, we dropped
anchor again at Penduffryn. On going ashore, we
found the traders organising to make a trip into the
interior of the island, to make moving pictures among
the real cannibals. Mr. Harding had been trying for
several years to get enough persons together to make <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a>p330</span>
this expedition. Here, too, another surprise awaited
us. It was Wada, our cook, who had deserted us at
Ysabel, now miraculously returned. He seemed to
have recovered his reason, so Jack put him once more
into the galley of the <i>Snark</i>.</p>

<p>The three moving picture men had been sent from
Paris by Pathé Frêres, famous the world over, to make
pictures of the reception of the American fleet in Sydney.
Having finished the fleet pictures, it was up to
them to bring back some good cinematographic records
of the Solomon Islands cannibals. For the first week
they were kept busy at Penduffryn, unpacking and setting
up their machines. Then all three, not being
used to the damp climate, had fallen sick with island
fever, and so could not make their inland trip until
they had recovered. Meanwhile, their chemicals,
which had been thoughtlessly unpacked, rapidly deteriorated
in the tropical atmosphere; and there was
no place to buy chemicals short of Australia. However,
the chemicals used on moving pictures are the
same as those used on ordinary films, so I was able to
supply sufficient material to last them until they got
back to Australia. Harding and Darbishire made
preparations for the trip, and were as enthusiastic as
children. For when white men exist for years on a
plantation without associating with others of their
race, they are apt to run wild when they come in contact
with a bunch of good fellows.</p>

<span class="caption">Making Copra at "Penduffryn," Solomon Islands
 <a class="imglst" href="#ILLUSTRATIONS">Imglst</a></span>
</div>

<p>We went up the Balesuna River six miles to a village, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a>p331</span>
named Charley after a native who had once
worked on the Penduffryn plantation. This was the
first time a white man had ever set foot in the interior
of the island of Guadalcanar. We were gone some
time, and secured some very unique and interesting
pictures.</p>

<p>By this time, our yaws and Jack's undiagnosed illness
were so bad that we were anxiously waiting for
the steamer. The doctors of Australia were our only
hope. Henry, Tehei, and the two Japs had practically
recovered from their ailments, but we white people
found life in the Solomons more trying every day.
The two Tahitians and Wada were to take charge
of the <i>Snark</i> and lie at Aola, Guadalcanar, until we
could resume the voyage, which we hoped would be
before long. On Tuesday, November 3, the steamship
<i>Makambo</i> dropped anchor at Penduffryn, and lay all
day discharging cargo and taking on copra and ivory-nuts.
That evening, Jack gave a big champagne dinner
to the Penduffrynites; then we went aboard, to
sail next morning, but the anchor-chain got foul, and
we did not get away until Wednesday noon. We went
to Neil Island, where we anchored for the night, and
then to Aola, where the <i>Snark</i> was lying. Thursday
noon we steamed out of the Solomons.</p>

<p>It seemed good to be on a large vessel like the
<i>Makambo</i> after being so long on the <i>Snark</i>. She
seemed as steady as a house, and I couldn't understand
why only a few persons came to meals. Had they <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a>p332</span>
been on the tiny <i>Snark</i>, doing a corkscrew twist out
in the sea, I could have understood readily. The
<i>Makambo</i> seemed like a very big ship to me after our
own boat; but the truth is, she was one of the smallest
ships in the South Sea trade. I had a deck-cabin with
a fine room-mate—a doctor from New Guinea.
Only one thing about him was unpleasant—his delirium
tremens. He had them two days. All night
he caught snakes and cockroaches; and whenever he
missed a large snake, he woke me up to catch it for
him. Oh, it was lovely for a sick man! Jack and
Mrs. London had the captain's room on the bridge,
so that they could keep up with their work.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, November 10, we sighted land, and
for the rest of the day steamed off shore. How good
it seemed to see real land again—not cocoanut trees
that just lifted out of the water, but real land! I
felt so good that I had to practise a new profession
of mine upon some of the passengers. While at
Penduffryn, I had learned much. One day Mr. Harding
told us of a black boy of his that could make fire.
We asked for a demonstration. The black came up
with two pieces of dry driftwood, and in less than
one minute had made fire, sufficient to start up a cook-stove.
Well, it looked so easy that I bet Jack that
I could do it inside half an hour; but when the bet was
made, they all told me that it was impossible for a
white man to do it. Jack said he had never seen a
black do it before, and that he had always regarded <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a>p333</span>
it as a myth in story-books. Anyway, I set to work,
and at the end of the half-hour I did not even have a
smoke started; so I lost the bet. But I was not discouraged.
I kept at it, and went among the blacks.
They taught me the trick, and still I could not do it;
but after working at it for several days, I learned to
do it quicker than even the blacks could do it. After
that, it was so easy! I brought two pieces of wood
along, and on the day we sighted land, I made a bet
with one of the passengers that I could make fire, and
I won in a walk. Then I bet him ten shillings that
he could not do it in half an hour—and of course,
I won.</p>

<p>It was on Sunday, November 15, 1908, that we approached
Sydney. We got off the heads at ten in
the morning, and for two hours steamed up what is
supposed to be the finest harbour in the world. Certainly,
I saw more big steamers and large full-rigged
ships at anchor and in the docks than I ever saw in
the New York or the San Francisco harbours. It
all seemed American, what of the great sign-boards
on every side, and it got more American as we went
along. I could hardly restrain my impatience to get
ashore.</p>

<p>Australia at last! Not under the exact circumstances
we had planned, but Australia at last. Our
hearts were very light as the <i>Makambo's</i> anchor
rumbled down in Sydney Harbor, and we found ourselves
once more in civilisation.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a>p334</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV<br />
THE END OF THE VOYAGE</h2>
<p class="toclink"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></p>
<p>At the dock, I got my luggage and Jack's ashore and
into a van, while Jack and Mrs. London went on up
to the Metropole Hotel. After the luggage had
passed the customs, I left it with Nakata, and got in
a cab which took me to my rooms in Elizabeth Street.
As I passed through the streets of Sydney, I could almost
imagine I was in Chicago, with its traffic and
hurry, its bustling and crowding. The Sydney street
railways seemed to give excellent service. The stores
are on the American plan, not the little shops so common
in England. I had expected to see a city very
much English, but my sober judgment is that Sydney
is much more American than otherwise. In my Kansas
home, I had always supposed Australia to be a bush
country; so it was an agreeable surprise to find it as
civilised as the States.</p>

<p>Sydney has nearly three quarters of a million people,
and they dress and talk like Americans. There are
dozens of good theatres, wherein are often enacted
American plays. ("The Girl from the Golden West,"
and "The Merry Widow," were on at that very time.)
About the only thing I could find fault with at first
glance was the excessive amount of jewellery worn <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a>p335</span>
by the women, and, as it seemed to me, very old-fashioned
jewellery—the kind we had sold over our
counters in Independence a dozen years before. But
anyway, I had a special grudge against all jewellery,
after seeing the South Sea Islanders with their shell
finger-rings, their big nose-and ear-rings, and uncouth
anklets and bracelets, for, after all, was it not the
same instinct for barbaric adornment that actuated the
rude natives and the highly decorated women of Australia?
or that actuates jewellery-wearing people the
world round?</p>

<p>The manager of the moving picture expedition at
Penduffryn had given me a letter to his agents, asking
that they secure these rooms in Elizabeth Street for
me. It was a suite of three well-furnished rooms,
cool and comfortable, and heavenly after the weary
months at sea, where I had slept in a bunk some inches
too short for me. It had been six months since I had
slept ashore—at Vila, New Hebrides, was the last
place—and it was with difficulty I could persuade the
rooms to stand still. I caught myself propping things
up so they wouldn't roll off the table or the dresser;
and it seemed strange that my bed did not buck and try
to pitch me out on the floor.</p>

<p>That evening I dined with the Londons, and then
we went to the theatre. Mrs. London still had attacks
of island fever. Jack had had the fever in its
worst form. But none the less, we enjoyed this evening,
which, for all we knew, might be the last we could <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a>p336</span>
spend together for a long time; for on the morrow,
the Londons were to go into hospital.</p>

<p>They went to the St. Malo Hospital, in Ridge Street,
North Sydney. Here the doctors found that Jack
was indeed a very sick man. The fever they could
subdue, but his mysterious ailment baffled them. Jack's
hands grew worse every day.</p>

<p>I went to a doctor, who burnt out my yaws with
caustic potash. He advised me to lay up for a time,
but I foolishly disregarded his counsel, and walked
about the streets of Sydney. As a consequence, my
yaws and fever grew more troublesome, and I was
forced to go to bed. It all ended by my going into
the Sydney Homeopathic Hospital, in Cleveland
Street. Here I received competent medical treatment,
under which my yaws rapidly healed. But the island
fever has a trick of recurring most unexpectedly; and
so it was with me. Just as I thought myself cured,
another attack of fever would prostrate me.</p>

<p>As I lay in that hospital, I often wondered what
would be the next stage of our journey. Where next
would the little <i>Snark</i> carry her anxious crew? From
now on, we would find ourselves among people very
much different from the men and women of the South
Seas. The world was broad, I reflected; there was
no knowing what further adventures might come our
way, or what strange things our wanderings would
show us. One thing was sure. Greater things lay
before us than we had left behind. Much as we had <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a>p337</span>
seen, we still had much to see. And I lay there and
planned the various things I would do when I got
well to make life on the yacht more comfortable; the
appliances I would buy, the ventilators needed, and
a hundred and one other things.</p>

<p>And then everything was dashed in a minute. The
matron of the hospital brought me a letter from Jack,
which contained discouraging news. I learned that
he was little better; and that he might be getting much
worse. His fever was pretty well conquered, but his
other ailment was unrelieved.</p>

<p>This other ailment was a puzzler. "The doctors
do not know what it is," ran the letter. "The biggest
specialist in Australia in skin-diseases has examined
me, and his verdict is that not only in his own
experience has he never seen anything like it, but that
no line is to be found about it in any of the medical
libraries. My hands are getting worse. They are
so bad to-day that I cannot close them. What it may
lead to, I do not know; but one thing I do know, and
that is that I must get back to my own climate. I
shall have to give up my voyage around the world.
I shall have a captain .&#160;.&#160;. to bring the <i>Snark</i> down
to Sydney, where I shall sell her. The steamer does
not sail for between three and four weeks from now.
I shall want you to go back on said steamer, and run
the engines, etc., on the trip down to Sydney .&#160;.&#160;.
I can assure you that I am not a bit happy over all
this."
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a>p338</span></p>

<p>I was dazed. I experienced a sense of deep loss.
For an hour I did not know what to do. To abandon
the voyage! To sell the yacht! For two years the
<i>Snark</i> had been home to me; and now I could hardly
bear to think of quitting her.</p>

<p>Securing my clothes from the matron, I went to the
St. Malo Hospital and enquired for Jack. I was
shown up to where he was lying. Mrs. London was in
bed in the same room, sick with the fever. She could
scarcely speak of the <i>Snark</i>, she felt so bad. Jack's
hands were certainly in terrible condition. The skin
was thick and hard, so that he could hardly close them.
And, of course, it was impossible for him to write.
He explained to me. There were many chances to
see the world, he said, and many voyages; but he had
only one pair of hands. Writing was his profession.
He could not give it up. Therefore, the voyage of
the <i>Snark</i> must be abandoned. The doctor had told
him that even if he were cured, the affliction might return
should he go among the deadly Solomons again.
Furthermore, a change of diet was necessary. The
things we had aboard the <i>Snark</i> were not suited to
the needs of a sick man. Fresh fruit and vegetables,
and fresh meats—not canned foods and salted meats—were
what he must have. So back he was going
to California, his native state, where his health had
always been perfect.</p>

<p>This was on December 9, 1908. The steamer
<i>Moresby</i>, on which a captain and myself were to go <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a>p339</span>
back to the Solomons after the <i>Snark</i>, did not sail till
the 31st. With good luck, we ought to be back in
Sydney by February 1.</p>

<p>The interval I spent in sightseeing. Australia is
a very interesting place, and, as I have said, reminds
one very much of the States. In the business section,
the streets are extremely narrow, but elsewhere they
broaden out. The street-car service is excellent, as
is the railway service. On the express trains they have
large American engines and the broad-gauge tracks.</p>

<p>The people are very enterprising; but I think the
heads of government must all be preachers or missionaries,
judging by the strange laws they make. For
instance: Unless a person is a guest at a hotel, he
is not allowed in on Sunday; if he wishes to see a
friend at one of the big hotels, he must stand outside
until the friend is called. The street-cars stop during
church hours, both in the morning and in the evening,
and so do the trains—even the fast express
trains stop wherever they happen to be at the time,
and do not start up again until church service is over.
Few restaurants are open on Sunday; and there are
no Sunday papers.</p>

<p>Anything said about Sydney is not complete without
a mention of the harbour—the largest and finest in
the world. It is miles and miles around, from head
to head, and the water is deep enough anywhere for
the greatest vessel to float. Almost anywhere, a
ship can tie up to the shore. An enormous amount <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340"></a>p340</span>
of shipping goes in and out of the heads every day;
about a dozen lines run to Europe by way of South
Africa and the Suez canal; and there are nearly as
many lines to America. A hundred steamers ply from
here to the South Seas and Asia. And there are
tramp steamers and independent sailing vessels.</p>

<p>When I went to see one ship off for the Gilbert
and Ellis Islands, I was amazed to find several old
friends. The first officer I had met in Vila, New
Hebrides. On a nearby sailing vessel I met old
David Wiley, the trader we had visited at Tanna.
And Mr. Darbishire was leaving on the steamer for
the Gilberts, to take up a government position at
Ocean Island. The crew was composed of Gilbert
Islanders, the first I had ever seen.</p>

<p>Near the close of December, Jack and Mrs. London
came out of hospital. We went to the great
Johnson-Burns prize fight; and while it was not much
of a fight—too one-sided, for the negro was by far
the better man—I would not have missed it for anything.
The Australians are worse negro-haters even
than Americans, and they hooted Johnson and cheered
Burns—which was not at all fair; and I did not
grieve much to see their idol beaten until he looked
like a piece of raw beefsteak.</p>

<p>Jack wrote up the fight for the American press, and
then gave me the original manuscript, which I value
highly. My valuation will be justified when I say
that, with one exception, I am the only person in the <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a>p341</span>
world to whom has been given an original manuscript
of Jack London, though more than one has asked.</p>

<p>I had Christmas dinner with Mr. Darbishire at the
Hotel Metropole. I ran the risk of arrest by going
in on a holiday. Just imagine a Christmas dinner in
a tropical climate. I had always associated Christmas
with some amount of snow. And we had no
cranberries! Christmas without cranberries! But
we made up for other deficiencies with the finest of
strawberries, and watermelon; which is something my
friends in America never do have at this season of
the year.</p>

<p>At last we secured our captain—an old man who
seemed to know considerable of the South Seas.
Jack and Mrs. London and Nakata went over to
Hobart, Tasmania, where it was thought the cooler
climate would be better for them. Captain Reed
and I boarded the <i>Moresby</i> and left Sydney at ten
o'clock on the evening of January 8. We should
have left much earlier, but delayed cargo kept the
ship waiting.</p>

<p>There were fourteen first class passengers on board.
Two were French missionaries, and the rest traders;
these last returning to the islands after a few weeks
of drunkenness in Sydney. (They called it their "vacation.")
In the morning they all looked alike—like
pieces of yellow cheese-cloth. Three or four
were down to breakfast, but soon left—one man
with his hand rather suspiciously over his mouth.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a>p342</span></p>

<p>The old captain who was to navigate the <i>Snark</i>
back to Sydney seemed a queer old chap. As he read
much and talked little, we got along all right. Soon
I felt so good that I had to go round tantalising the
seasick people. I knew most of the traders. I
opened a fresh box of chocolates, and with exaggerated
generosity passed them around. One fellow was so
ungrateful as to throw a stick at me.</p>

<p>The <i>Moresby</i> was a regular old tub—not so large
as the <i>Makambo</i>, that we had come down in. Built
in 1879, she was condemned in 1905, as the underwriters
declared the boilers were not safe; but they
gave them a coat of paint, and the <i>Moresby</i> continued
to run. The accommodations were not bad—electric
lights, fans, and very good food. The officers
and the stewardess were very jolly. While I was
sorry to leave Sydney, if only for a few weeks, I found
my sorrow somewhat alloyed by the very good time
I had aboard the <i>Moresby</i>. We were to get into
Brisbane on the 11th, and from there it is only nine or
ten days to the Solomons.</p>

</div>

<p>We got in Brisbane on Monday morning. After
finding out that we would not sail until ten o'clock
that night, the most of the passengers went up to the
city. I got away from the crowd, and walked around
to see the place. I think, if I were going to live in
Australia, I should choose Brisbane in preference to
Sydney. Sydney is a livelier and busier city, and Brisbane
is just the opposite: quiet and slow; but it has <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a>p343</span>
such broad, pretty green streets, houses like the California
bungalows, and such splendid car service, that
Sydney is far outshadowed. It is very tropical, too,
in Brisbane; the people dress in white, and only get
busy toward evening.</p>

<p>His name was Bannerman, and he came aboard here
at Brisbane. It was nearly midnight before we cast
off and headed down the river. At eight o'clock Bannerman
had been deposited with several trunks and
suitcases on board by a crowd of noisy young fellows.
They had strolled the deck arm-in-arm until we cast
off, singing: "For He's a Jolly Good Fellow," and
"The King of the Cannibal Islands." And after we
had swung away from the wharf, they cried after
him to bring them back a few human heads, and
they gave him advice as to how to handle the cannibals.</p>

<p>In the cabin the traders had been playing cards all
evening, and before turning in I stopped to watch
them.</p>

<p>Bannerman was standing behind, telling the traders
who he was and where he came from; and from his
pretentious talk, he must have been a person of some
importance in Brisbane and elsewhere. Now he was
going to the islands to rest for awhile at a trading station.
He had signed on for a two-year job; as he
expressed it, he was tired of civilisation, and of people;
he wanted to get to a place where he could rest and
take things easy. Of course, he knew that there might <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a>p344</span>
be a little trouble with the natives, but that did not
bother him.</p>

<p>He went on talking in a loud voice of what he had
done and what he could do. The traders paid slight
heed to him; poker, as these men played it, took all
their attention. Finally, I went to my cabin and
turned in. Next morning we were out of sight of
land, with a rough head-sea retarding our progress,
and sending spray all over the ship. We pitched and
rolled as only a South Sea trading steamer can roll.
The traders were at their poker game when I went
below, but Bannerman was not to be seen, and for
several days he failed to show up at the table, and
was nearly forgotten until we were half-way to the
islands.</p>

<p>The sea was now as smooth as a mill-pond. The
after-poop-deck had been covered with an awning.
We were gathered on deck one morning after breakfast,
the traders telling stories of the islands, when
Bannerman came up rather shaky on his legs and
joined us. He had nothing to say about himself now.
A trader, Swanson by name, had been among the islands
for thirty years and had had some bad experiences
with the savages. He was relating some
trouble he had had with a new bunch of tough recruits,
where all the crew on his trading schooner was killed,
and he had reached a missionary's house after days
without food or water.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a>p345</span></p>

<p>"On what island did this happen?" enquired Bannerman.</p>

<p>"On Guadalcanar," replied Swanson; and turning,
he seemed to see Bannerman for the first time.
"Why, I believe that is where you are to be stationed,
isn't it? What part do you go to?"</p>

<p>I could see by the way the traders looked at each
other that Swanson was about to "string" this green
recruit.</p>

<p>"Why, I will be with Collins Brothers, but—"</p>

<p>"What! Collins Brothers?" and turning to
another trader, Swanson asked: "Wasn't that
where Jack Dupretz was killed?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the other assured him. "Only a few
months ago, too. But I hear it was the bush boys
did the work, so it's safe enough there now for nearly
a year—you know, they never come down, only once
a year."</p>

<p>"But they told me this was the most peaceful place
in the islands," began Bannerman.</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon it is 'bout as peaceful as any place
in the group; but don't you think for a minute that
you can go to sleep anywhere up here with both eyes
shut. Of course, you are well armed and have plenty
of ammunition?"</p>

<p>"I have a revolver and plenty of cartridges," panted
Bannerman.</p>

<p>"That's good; but if I were you I would get several <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a>p346</span>
guns and a barrel of ammunition; you can never
tell what will happen here."</p>

<p>Now that the traders were tired of poker and had
found an easy mark, they started in to throw him into
a state of panic.</p>

<p>I had scratched my foot that morning, and careful
that the yaws did not get started again in the wound,
I was washing the cut every half-hour with permanganate
of potash and mercury.</p>

<p>While the traders were busy telling their narrow experiences
with the cannibals and about the different
fellows who had gone to the roasting pot, I had backed
out of the group and was anointing my foot with the
antiseptic wash. It was necessary for me to roll up
my trousers, exposing the red scars of my yaws.
This attracted Bannerman's attention.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with your legs?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing now," I answered. "Have just recovered
from a slight dose of yaws."</p>

<p>"What's yaws?"</p>

<p>"You'll know soon enough," a trader spoke up.
"Wait a few weeks from now. Everybody down
here gets yaws—won't be healthy if you don't. You
see, it's just a slight form of leprosy."</p>

<p>"But a man can be careful and not catch it, can't
he?" quavered the now thoroughly discomfited Bannerman.</p>

<p>"No use; it catches the new fellows who have not <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a>p347</span>
been 'climatised;' after you have a good dose of it
once, you'll be all right."</p>

<p>"But I was told it was such a healthy climate."</p>

<p>The men laughed this remonstrance down.</p>

<p>"Sure it's a healthy climate, and you'll enjoy it as
soon as you get over your first attack of yaws or fever.
Of course, the fever may hold off the yaws for awhile—depends
on which comes first."</p>

<p>This was about the last straw to Bannerman. He
drew off to himself to think over his troubles to come.</p>

<p>The traders let him alone for the rest of the day;
but they were preparing new tales to tell him. They
had intended to help things along that night at dinner,
but Bannerman kept to his bunk, although the sea
was as smooth as it ever gets, and it was not until lunch
next day that they got a chance to make his life more
miserable. This was his first appearance at the table.</p>

<p>"That's right; come and fill up on white man's
grub while you've got the chance, for two years is a
long time to live on native <i>kai-kai</i> and tinned foods."</p>

<p>"Well, I can stand it, if you fellows can," answered
Bannerman bravely.</p>

<p>"Right you are! Now that's the way I like to
hear a man talk. I tell you, men, he will be able to
handle the black boys, all right. Don't ever let them
see you are afraid of them," he cautioned the other,
"or they will sure get you."</p>

<p>Every trader present had a tale of horror to tell.
By the time the meal was over, Bannerman was in a <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a>p348</span>
state of collapse. The captain sat at the head of the
table and said nothing during the meal. After we
had finished eating, I went on the bridge with him,
and we got to talking over this new trader.</p>

<p>"He's the easiest mark I ever saw," exclaimed the
captain. "The men generally have a good time with
the new traders each trip, but this fellow seems to take
it more seriously than any of the others. If he don't
get wise before we reach Tulagi, I'll have to set him
right—wouldn't be the square thing to send him
ashore in the state he's in."</p>

<p>We got in Tulagi just after dark, and the dozen
schooners that always come after their mail and as
much liquor as they can hold, were anchored in the bay.
Immediately after our anchor was dropped, their passengers
swarmed aboard, all heading for the bar. I
knew some of them, and I told all of them of the way
we had frightened Bannerman, and they determined
to help the thing along. So one captain asked three
of us and Bannerman to go over to his schooner. As
we got alongside, thirty natives just recruited from
Malaita gave a yell, and the captain told us to get
our guns ready. Poor Bannerman said he had no
gun. Then the captain asked him if he had come
to the Solomons to commit suicide. "Why, no man
ever has one hand off his gun here!" the captain declared.
At this, Bannerman wanted to go back to
the steamer, but the captain said he thought the blacks
were in a good humour now. The blacks were a raw, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a>p349</span>
savage lot, stark naked, and adorned, as they thought,
most becomingly, with big plugs in their ears, and nose-rings,
shell anklets and armlets. But it was their
bleached woolly hair that made them look most terrible.</p>

<p>We told Bannerman stories, and the captain, innocently
as could be, mentioned a big massacre up near
Collins Brothers' plantation, where Bannerman was to
work. Bannerman told him this identical place was
to be his future home; whereupon the captain elaborated
a fiction as to three white men who had lost their
heads at Collins' place a few weeks before. (As a
matter of fact, Collins' plantation is really one of the
most peaceful spots in the Solomons.) Bannerman
then and there declared that he would go back to
Brisbane on the same steamer that had brought him.
But by next morning, he informed us that he had decided
to try a few months of it. I think the captain
of the <i>Moresby</i> had seen the joke was too far advanced,
and had told him that we were "stringing"
him.</p>

<p>Governor Woodford, whose station is at Tulagi,
had just bought a steamer in order to keep in touch
with the other islands, and the traders were having
great fun about it. It was just about the size of the
<i>Snark</i>, and looked like a tug-boat. It was painted
slate colour, the same as the British warships, and
had several small guns mounted on deck. All the
discipline of a warship was maintained. A native had <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a>p350</span>
been trained to blow a bugle; at eight in the morning
the flag went up, and at sunset it came down, while
the black bugler played his best, and all the schooners
followed example in the raising and lowering of flags.
At a civilised place, this would seem all right, but at
Tulagi it was comical. The traders talked proudly
of the "Solomon Island fleet" and were even facetiously
arranging for it to follow the American fleet's
example and make a trip around the world.</p>

<p>The next morning after our arrival, this little
steamer came in from Malaita, where it had been enforcing
the law. A white missionary at Ulava had
had trouble with the natives, and they had threatened
to kill him; so he cleared out in a whale-boat
to the governor's, who sent the steamer there. As
they steamed up the lagoon they were fired on by the
natives, who had old Snyder rifles. When they landed
fifty police natives, they were attacked with spears
and arrows, several being killed. Then the steamer
sent several shells into the village, and killed seven
natives. Poor Bannerman's heart throbbed on hearing
this—for the captain of the <i>Moresby</i> could not
say that this was a joke. He left the next morning
for his plantation, accompanied by six natives, and I
never heard of him again. Anyway, I'll bet that he
wished more than once on that trip that he were back
in Brisbane.</p>

<p>We found the <i>Snark</i> in good condition at Aola.
We put fuel and water aboard, stored provisions, and <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a>p351</span>
unfurled the sail; and then we set out on the backward
trip to Sydney.</p>

<p>On January 27 we set out. If the weather were
favourable, we ought to get into Sydney in about
twenty days. That we did not do so was owing to
the captain's overcarefulness. We quickly discovered
that Captain Reed was a very timid skipper. But let
the words I wrote at the time tell the story.</p>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Friday, January 29, 1909.</h3>—It's nine o'clock, and
Henry and Wada and Tehei are asleep on the deck
for'ard. It is Henry's turn at the wheel, but I'm
supposed to be on the lookout. It's such a fine night,
with nearly a full moon, and so warm and cool at
the same time that it seems there could be no more
perfect a night than this. A four-knot breeze and an
uncommonly quiet sea, and not a cloud.</div>

<p>I am wearing a <i>lava-lava</i> only, and feel as if I'd
like to discard it—not from heat, but it seems wicked
to wear anything such a night as this. Those two
mystical islands we have been heading for ever since
we left the Solomons are just ahead about five miles—Belonna
and Rennell. In an hour we will have to
go about on the other tack to keep from cutting off
a few hundred feet of Rennell. If I had my way, I
should heave-to until morning, then go ashore, for
these people are the most primitive in the world—no
stranger has ever reported setting foot ashore here,
unless a man named Stephens, who, when we left Sydney,
was just getting up an expedition to visit these <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"></a>p352</span>
two islands, has been here by now. I am anxious to
see Stephens about it.</p>

<p>But what a night! I can't get over it. The sails
are just drawing comfortably, and there is no sound
except the swish of the water around the bow as we
cut through it. It seems as if millions of stars are
trying to help the moon in making things lighter; and
the Southern Cross is just overhead. Henry has gone
to the wheel, and sits gazing at the stars and singing
South Sea songs—now of Samoa, now of Hawaii,
and now of Tahiti, taking me back to the good times
we had in those islands. The <i>Snark</i> really needs no
steering to-night, but someone must be at the wheel.</p>

<p>And this is my last of the South Seas for perhaps a
long time, perhaps forever. Those tall cocoanut
trees on Rennell, which we can plainly see, are the
last links of the islands. The next trees we see will
be of the white man's country. I'm almost sorry to
get back, although the last few months among the
South Sea islands have played havoc with the crew
of the <i>Snark</i>. My legs have scars that will never
disappear—a sure sign I am not welcomed here.
Yes, it is better that we are leaving.</p>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Sunday, January 31, 1909.</h3>—Well, I'm contented
now, for I've seen the wonderful natives of Rennell,
and this is how it happened. Yesterday morning,
when I came on deck, I found the <i>Snark</i> too close to
the shore of Rennell to be comfortable, and it was not
a nice shore to see, either, for the whole coast seemed <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"></a>p353</span>
to be jotted with rocks, and the sides of the island
were nearly perpendicular. I called the captain and
we went about, having decided it would be better to
go around the island from the other end, for the wind
was dead ahead the way we were going and we were
making more leeway than anything else. So we sailed
along the coast all morning, and right after dinner
Henry discovered a canoe putting off to us. We
backed the head-sails and waited for them. There
were two natives in the first canoe, and right after
them came a canoe with three natives. The canoes
were well-built Polynesian outriggers, and larger than
any I've seen, but the natives, big, brown-skinned, long-haired
fellows, none under six feet in height, and all
muscle, were the strangest yet. Each had a short
spear with a long bone point—very fine pieces of
work. Two of them had big iron-wood clubs. The
largest, most intelligent fellow, whom we found to be
the king, was seated in a curious chair, made to fit
into the canoe. After they had got aboard, I collected
the five spears, two clubs, and the chair together on
the skylight, then took a half-tin of biscuits, a few
fish-hooks, several strings of beads, four old files, a
broken sheath-knife, and the hoop-iron off an old water-cask;
and putting my things in a pile next to theirs,
offered to trade. They jumped on my things with
a whoop. I made some photographs of them. They
did not object, but I know they didn't catch on to what
I was doing, for they wore a look of wonder during <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a>p354</span>
all the time I was photographing them. One thing
that particularly struck me was the fine white teeth
they all had, and their hair would have made any girl
proud.</div>

<p>All the time they were aboard, they were trying
to make me understand something that excited them.
They would shout and throw their hands in the air,
and jump around the deck, frightening the captain
nearly into fits. He would have nothing to do with
them, but sat on a box with a gun in his hands throughout
their stay. But they did not know what a gun was.
I am always interested in this kind of people, so tried
to talk to them, as did Henry, but it was the first time
I've seen him unable to use the few words he knows.
The natives would have nothing to do with him or with
the others, for they were too near their own colour,
but I was white, and therein lay a great mystery.
All the time they jabbered and pointed ashore. As
near as I could make out, they wanted us to go in and
anchor; but I would not get in among such a crowd of
savages for anything, though I should have liked to
see their women.</p>

<p>They wore only a small loin-cloth, made from the
bark of a tree, and no other ornaments. They were
tattooed all over with designs that were new to me
and the king had a small ring of shell in his nose.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="Trading_Station_Langakauld-Ugi"></a>
<div class="hdimg"><a href="images/i354-hd.jpg">larger</a></div>
<img src="images/i354.jpg" width="400" height="291" alt="" />
<span class="caption">Trading Station, Langakauld-Ugi Solomons
 <a class="imglst" href="#ILLUSTRATIONS">Imglst</a></span>
</div>

<p>They finally got so excited that the captain was
frightened, and to make them leave he pointed his
gun at them. But they only grabbed for it, thinking <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a>p355</span>
it was a present. The iron and brass work interested
them the most. They would feel of it and try to
break pieces off, and the boats they examined all over,
making queer noises at everything they could not understand.
Finally the captain got so aroused that he
could stand it no longer; he told me to start the engines.
While I was getting it ready, five excited faces
watched me through the skylight, but as the first gas
explosion came, those five excited faces vanished. Our
visitors had jumped overboard into their canoes, leaving
behind the things I had given them in exchange for
their spears and the chair. Also, they had left two
strings of porpoise teeth (worth about £2 in the Solomons,
where they use them for money). I kept the
porpoise teeth, but the other things we wrapped in an
old oilskin and threw into one of the boats. I went
below and threw on the clutch, and when I came up,
I saw the five men fighting over the old iron I had
given them. They fought and squabbled, and
dropped the biscuits overboard into the water, apparently
not recognising their value. One, to whom
I had given a stick of tobacco, had tasted it, and finding
it nauseous, had thrown it away.</p>

<p>We steamed ten miles into the passage between the
two islands; then I stopped the engine and we slowly
drifted through. At sunset a canoe followed us for
an hour, but we drifted too fast for them, and they
gave it up when about five miles from shore. I'll
wager it was a tired canoe-load of natives that put in <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a>p356</span>
to land last night, for they had to paddle hard against
the current.</p>

<p>The captain seems to have a notion in his head
that we mustn't make any speed. What his reason
is, I don't know.</p>

<p>To-day we are calmed about twenty miles off the
islands, and it's hotter than sin. The tar in the deck
is melting and bubbling up through the seams, so that
a person feels as if walking on molasses, when compelled
to walk.</p>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Saturday, February 13, 1909.</h3>—The day after we
cleared Rennell we were struck by a southeast squall,
which settled down into a gale that lasted for four
days—the most miserable four days I ever spent on
the <i>Snark</i>. Rain, wind, and combing seas all the time!
The seas were so high that it was no use trying to
beat against them, so we just lay and pitched and rolled,
with the seas breaking on the deck all the while, until
every stitch of our clothing was wet through. Oilcloth
and rubbers are useless against such weather.
The salt water would get below, in spite of all we
could do. We had the skylights and hatches battened
down, too. Only the staysail remained set. The
fourth day we tried to set a jib, but it was carried
away, and the main jib-boom stay broke off, so we
were in danger of having the flying-jib smashed, but
we made it solid with watch tackles, and when the
wind had settled a little we hoisted the mizzen double-reefed,
and another jib. We soon had to lower the <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a>p357</span>
jib, and Henry, instead of taking it on deck, lashed
it to the jib-boom, and in one night it was torn to
threads by the constant plunging into the seas. Now
we have only a small storm-jib left to take us into
Sydney.</div>

<p>The fifth day, the wind let us, but we still had the
heavy seas. On trying to make a little sail, we found
the rigging on the mizzen-mast to be in bad condition,
and it took all hands a day to repair it. Then the
gooseneck on the staysail broke, and as we have no
other, we patched it up with ropes. On raising the
mainsail, the throat-halyards carried away, and when
they were repaired, the peak did the same. A good
stiff wind and the heavy seas continued, so we dared
not put on full sail, but have been creeping along under
double-reefed main and mizzen sails and have not attempted
to set the other jib. This old captain is certainly
afraid to make sail, for during the last few days
we could easily have had reefs out of the sails and the
jib set; but as the barometer is still low and he does
not like the look of the leaden sky, he will not do
it. He and I had a hot argument a few days ago because
I wanted more sail put on, and he informed me
that he was captain, and for me to tend to my own
business—so that is what I am doing. But I know
we could be a couple of hundred miles to the south
if he would not be so careful. Henry is madder than
a hornet; says if we stop anywhere south of Sydney
he will go ashore, for he does not want to work for <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a>p358</span>
such a timid old man. But he couldn't do what he
threatens, for the authorities would not allow a dark-skinned
man ashore.</p>

<p>Henry has a fit of grouchiness, so he is snappy and
growling all the time. Tehei is so homesick that he
can't be cheerful. Wada is cheerful enough; but take
it all in all, it is mighty unpleasant company.</p>

<p>Here we are only about three hundred and fifty
miles from the Solomons, and we've been out eighteen
days, with sixteen hundred miles yet to go, and Wada
says there are only provisions enough for ten days
more, by economising; and it's not the best of grub,
either. Salt-horse, sea biscuit, tinned salmon, beans,
rice, and about twelve pounds of tea. More of the
captain's folly, for he does not know how to stock
a vessel of this kind. At first, when we left the
Solomons, I did not know that there was not plenty of
provisions, or what poor stuff it was, for I was living
on fruit and fish nearly all the time; but now the fruit
is gone and the fish that we catch are the deep-water
kind, dry and tasteless, and only fit for soup or for
eating raw.</p>

<p>I hooked an enormous shark a few days ago, but it
broke a large iron hook—a foot long and of
<span class="fraction"><sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub></span>
inch iron. It was all of sixteen feet long. Tehei says
that's the reason that we don't get fair wind—the
shark is hoodooing us.</p>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Sunday, February 14, 1909.</h3>—Last night we rolled
about on the swells of a calm, and we all felt better, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a>p359</span>
for surely by morning the wind would freshen, and
it would be a northeast wind, for that's the wind that
should be blowing at this time of the year, but up to
now it's still calm, and the little wind that is blowing is
from the same old direction—southeast, and it's hotter
than blazes.</div>

<p>I'm commencing to chafe under so long a spell of
hard luck. For awhile I did not care, but to-day I've
been looking over old pictures of home, and home postcards.
But one thing is certain—I'll be home in less
than one year now, probably before another Christmas.
I'll leave Australia as soon as I can get away from the
<i>Snark</i>. A short time in Europe, and then home.</p>

<p>I don't think I've mentioned a dog Mrs. London
got off the wrecked <i>Minota</i> in the Solomons—a scotch
terrier, only a pup when she came aboard, but grown
since to full size. All aboard liked to play with her.
She would sit and cock her head to one side while a
person talked to her. Even the old, grumpy captain
liked to play with her. During the heavy weather last
week, Peggy could not walk on deck without being
thrown from one rail to the other, and I think possibly
she was injured internally; and with the lack of fresh
food and exercise, she died. Mrs. London will feel
bad about it, for she told me to take particular care
of Peggy—that she was going to take her back to
California. Now it seems as if one of the crew were
gone, and the naturally superstitious Kanakas are mumbling
that it is a "no good" sign.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360"></a>p360</span></p>

<p>This morning I caught a small shark—six feet four
inches—but threw him overboard again, for the
Kanakas were too lazy to cut him up; and after cutting
up one shark, I never want to tackle another. Besides,
it's so hot that no one wants to exert himself.
No wind, so no one is needed at the wheel. Everyone
is stretched on deck, under the boats or in the cockpit.</p>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Sunday, February 21, 1909.</h3>—To-day is like last
Sunday, only more so. No wind, plenty of sun, and the
pitch runs cheerfully down the deck-seams. Last week
we had some pretty fair weather that would take us
along at six knots for as long as half a day, then the
eternal flap, flap of the sails again. One day we made
a hundred miles, but from seven to forty was the run
on other days. Sharks are getting thick around us—so
thick that when we try for other fish, these brutes
swallow our bait. Then we have to hook a tackle
to them, and heave on deck to get our hook and line
back again. One day we caught three while fishing
for dolphin. It's interesting to find the miscellaneous
assortment of fish in their stomachs. Often, the fish
will be still alive. But we get other things besides
sharks. Other fish are plentiful, too. Henry speared
a five-foot dolphin, and Tehei catches two or three
twenty and twenty-five-pound bonita every day with
his pearl shell hooks. If we happen to have a little
headway at night, flying fish will come aboard, and if
I can find them before the Kanakas, I have a good <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"></a>p361</span>
breakfast. But if they see them first, they pull off
their wings and head, and eat them raw. When a
bonita is pulled aboard, while it's still flopping on
deck, the Kanakas will slice out a few steaks and start
eating—very much to the disgust of the captain.</div>

<p>And nearly every night we take on a few passengers—big
reef-birds that have flown too far from their
homes, and have come aboard to rest. They will
get in the life-boat or on the stern-sail, and tuck their
heads under their wings and pay no attention to us,
unless we try to touch them, and then they will give
a sharp peck which is not pleasant, for their long beaks
have edges like a saw. In the morning they go away
hunting for fish; then at night I think I sometimes recognise
the same birds back again.</p>

<p>We are now under regular deep-sea discipline, with
watches the same as on a full-rigged ship. This captain
is not used to sailing a small vessel like this. Probably
he would be all right on a square-rigger, but he makes
entirely too much fuss here. Henry and I come on
watch at six o'clock until eight; then the captain and
Tehei until twelve, midnight; then Henry and I until
four; then the captain and Tehei and Wada until eight.
Wada goes below to prepare breakfast, and at eight
Henry and I go on until noon. Then the captain and
Wada until four. Wada takes the wheel from two to
four every afternoon, then Henry and I the first dog-watch
to six. Now, we do not need a lookout here
in the open sea, where there are no steamer routes, <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a>p362</span>
and with such a long time on deck at night, one must
get some time for sleep, so of course it must be gotten
in the daytime; and the consequence is that we don't
get any work done on deck, and it's precious little I
can do in the engine room.</p>

<p>The most serious thing now is the grub. It's running
pretty low. The potatoes and onions are all
gone. We have enough rice and beans for about ten
days longer, with eleven small tins of meat for variety.
The sugar is all gone, and we have enough graham
flour for a week. It's so full of weevils that I don't
care how soon it goes; but we have enough sea-biscuit
(also full of weevils) to last several months; five gallons
of molasses, and two hundred cocoanuts, so I
guess we won't starve. And then, fish are very plentiful,
but I do hope it will not come down to a fish diet,
for I'm sick of them already.</p>

<p>Tehei, Henry and Wada take turns about being
sick, but the captain makes them stand watch just the
same. Tehei is useless when he is the least bit sick.
He will sit at the wheel in a daze and cannot possibly
steer closer than a point to the course; which makes
the captain furious, as he watches the wake zig-zag
like a serpent astern. He will let loose a round of adjectives
that I have difficulty in understanding; and of
course Tehei cannot understand, but he knows he is
in some way to blame, so he sits up and looks wildly
about to see what is wrong. Captain often curses the
weather, the wind, the <i>Snark</i>, and everything he can <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a>p363</span>
think of that keeps us from getting to Sydney any
faster; then Tehei sits up again to see what is wrong
this time, for he thinks that of course, whatever it
is, it must be his fault.</p>

<p>We are twenty-five days out to-day, and just half-way;
the kerosene is nearly finished, so we are sailing
along without sidelights.</p>

<p>And the captain swears, the Kanakas growl, Wada
feigns sick, and I keep hunting in different lockers
hoping to find something to eat.</p>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Sunday, February 28, 1909.</h3>—Thirty-three days out
to-day, and the grub nearly gone. Our five-gallon
can of molasses proved to be only an empty tin, so
now we have only weevily hardtack, half-spoiled
beans, and tea. We find that soaking the hardtack in
tea for fifteen minutes will bring most of the weevils
to the top so that they can be skimmed off. But the
beans are hopeless. They are eatable, and that's all.
The fish have deserted us, too; but as poor as eating
is, it will keep us alive for a couple of weeks, if necessary.
But we might go into the Clarence river to-morrow,
if we do not get a fair wind. If we get the
wind, we could make Sydney in three days, but it's
a nasty head-wind now, and we are only pitching up
and down and not going ahead. Clarence river is
twenty miles away, only three hours, if I had gasolene;
but what I have will only run about five miles, and that
will be needed to take us through the bar.</div>

<p>Since last Sunday we have had a fair wind for two <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364"></a>p364</span>
days, which set us along one hundred miles a day.
Then, when everyone had visions of a square meal in
Sydney inside of two or three days, the wind shifted
and blew a stiff gale for two days. We put double
reefs in the mizzen and mainsails, and a single one
in the staysail, then put on our oilskins and settled
down to two days and nights on deck, with only a few
hours' sleep. Everything wet, and no food. Imagine
our tempers! Yesterday the sea and wind quieted
down, but we still have the head-wind. The sky is
clear, however, and the barometer has gone up; so
we are hoping.</p>

<p>Tehei is quite surprised at the number of steamers
in this world. Every day, from ten to twenty pass
us, going all directions, and Tehei wonders where
they all come from. A revolving light from a big
lighthouse twenty miles ashore also makes him wonder.
I'm going to have a good time with him in
Sydney.</p>

<div class="head3">
<h3>Friday, March 5, 1909.</h3>—At last we are at anchor
in Sydney Harbor—thirty-six days from the Solomons.
It seems mighty good to get an all night in,
and something to eat. Sunday night, we got a stiff
squall from the northeast, which settled down into
a steady wind, taking us along over one hundred
miles a day—the best we had since leaving the islands.</div>

<p>Wednesday evening, at five o'clock, I started the
engines just outside the heads, and we steamed up the <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a>p365</span>
harbour faster than the harbour regulations allow, for
we wanted to catch the doctor before six o'clock and
be allowed to land; and we were lucky enough to
catch him as he was leaving a steamer just in from
China. He passed us all. Then we proceeded up
the harbour and anchored in Rose Bay. The customs
officers soon came aboard; then a boat-load of reporters.
I did not care for reporters, for I was hungry;
so Tehei, the captain, and I pulled ashore. The captain
took a tram for Sydney, while I hunted up a
grocery store, and loaded myself down with provisions—all
I could carry. Tehei was supposed to stand
by the boat, but I found him, wild-eyed, watching the
trains.</p>

<p>Thursday morning we got a tug to take us up the
harbour, for my gasolene tanks were so near empty
that I was afraid of the engine's stopping before we
got up, all of which would have caused us no end of
trouble. We anchored at Johnson's Bay, only fifteen
minutes from Sydney by ferry. Jack and Mrs. London
and Nakata came out in the afternoon and were
glad to see everything all right—except Peggy.
Mrs. London felt very bad over her dying. I went to
Sydney with them, to the Australian Hotel. I took
Tehei, who had the time of his life on the ferries and
trams and elevators. Nakata took him out for supper,
and I ate with Mr. and Mrs. London. I was a
strange spectacle, with two months' growth of hair,
nearly over my ears. But Jack made me come with <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366"></a>p366</span>
them; and if he could stand it, I knew I could. Everyone
else was in evening dress, for the Australian is
the aristocratic hotel of Australia! And the way I
did eat! and Jack piled more and more in front of
me. He said he knew how good fresh food tasted
after a long sea-trip. Then we took Tehei to the
Tivoli Theatre (vaudeville), where he amused the
audience by his open appreciation of each turn. But
the moving pictures were his greatest delight. On
the way home, we got an immense watermelon; and
after we got to the <i>Snark</i>, he woke Wada and Henry,
and the last thing I heard was Tehei telling them about
it—and the first thing in the morning.</p>

<p>Now people are coming aboard to look at the <i>Snark</i>,
and she will soon be sold. I shall remain until another
engineer takes hold; then I shall go to Europe and
home.</p>

<p>From the time of our arrival in Sydney with the
<i>Snark</i>, things moved swiftly to their conclusion.
When a couple of weeks had gone by, and a new
engineer had been secured to take charge of the boat,
the day came for me to say good-bye to the genial
people with whom I had journeyed for so long. It
was hard, but it had to be done. One consolation, however,
I had. Some day we should see each other
again. The Londons and I were residents of the same
country; and the Tahitians would probably be found
as long as they lived somewhere in the confines of
 <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367"></a>p367</span>
Polynesia. And of course, Wada and Nakata I should
meet at some future date in Honolulu.</p>

<p>Poor Jack and Mrs. London! They were quite
broken-hearted at giving up the cruise. They could
speak of nothing else. At the last, after having said
good-bye to the <i>Snark</i> and to those aboard, I went up to
take dinner with the Londons at the Australian Hotel.</p>

<p>We said little in parting. There was nothing to
say. Our grief at the break-up of the little <i>Snark</i>
family was too deep for words. For two years,
through savage seas, we had fared together; comforts
and discomforts, good luck and bad luck, all had been
borne together. And now it was at an end. The
cruise of the <i>Snark</i> was a thing of the past.</p>

<p>The time came for me to go. We shook hands,
promising that we should meet again in America.
Then I turned and walked very slowly from the room.
<span class="xpno"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a>p368</span></p>

<p class="toclink"><a href="#CONTENTS">TOC</a></p>
<p>So ended the cruise of the <i>Snark</i>. Henry, the Polynesian
sailor, left Sydney on March 30, 1909, for
Pago-Pago, Samoa. A week before, Tehei, the Society
Islander, had gone with a sailor's bag full of
gaudy calico, bound for Bora Bora. Wada San, the
Japanese cook, sailed on April 11th for Honolulu.</p>

<p>Martin Johnson left Sydney on March 31st, on the
steamer <i>Asturias</i>, after an unsuccessful attempt to join
the South African expedition of Theodore Roosevelt.
His letter did not reach Mr. Roosevelt until after all
preparations for the trip had been made, when it was
of course too late to consider his application.</p>

<p>The <i>Asturias</i> stopped for several days in Melbourne,
Adelaide, and Perth, as well as in Hobart, Tasmania.
Then it proceeded up through the Indian Ocean to
Ceylon; thence through the Arabian Sea to Aden; and
from there up the Red Sea and through the Suez
Canal to Port Said. At Port Said, Mr. Johnson made
another effort to get in communication with the Roosevelt
party, but found that they had left three days before.
Passing through the Mediterranean to Naples,
Mr. Johnson left the <i>Asturias</i>, and spent some days
viewing Rome, Pompeii, and other interesting historical
spots. His next objective was Paris, where he
arrived in June. Here he secured a position as an <span class="xpno"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a>p369</span>
electrician at Luna Park, but not long after, feeling
a desire to see his home again, he crossed the channel
to England. At Liverpool, early in September, he
stowed away on a cattle-boat, and after a trying thirteen
days arrived in Boston, the only member of the
<i>Snark</i> crew to make the complete circuit of the world.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Jack London took Nakata, the Japanese
cabin-boy, and sailed on a tramp steamer for
Ecuador, South America. They arrived at their Glen
Ellen, California, ranch in June. Mr. London found
his native climate most healthful, and though all three
were frequently brought down by attacks of fever during
the ensuing six months, his mysterious ailment soon
disappeared, and his hands regained their normal appearance.
